Douglas Adams The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has , or rather had , a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences. It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy , not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman. Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor , of which no Earthman had ever heard either. Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one , more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. It begins with a house. Chapter 1 The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means , it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too , most of his friends worked in advertising. It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead. At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush , so. Scrub. Shaving mirror , pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it. "Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces. Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job , which was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. "Come off it, Mr Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. "I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first." "I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, "this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!" "First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?" Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. "What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses." Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why -he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. 
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody 
had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him. 
Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you 
know." 
"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman 
arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come 
to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of 
windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me." 
"But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month." 
"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't 
exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or 
anything." 
"But the plans were on display ..." 
"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them." 
"That's the display department." 
"With a torch." 
"Ah, well the lights had probably gone." 
"So had the stairs." 
"But look, you found the notice didn't you?" 
"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused 
lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard." 
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the 
cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house. Mr Prosser frowned at it. 
"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said. 
"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it." 
"You'll like the bypass." 
"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven't 
got a leg to stand on and you know it." Mr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. "Mr Dent," he said. "Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. "Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?" "How much?" said Arthur. "None at all," said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him. By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed. Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society , with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough. He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being nicely inconspicuous. He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck. He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one , an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out. Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. "Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for. "Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks. Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really. Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?" "I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions. In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts. Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth. Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day. In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage. The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in. A shadow moved across him again. "Hello Arthur," said the shadow. Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him. "Ford! Hello, how are you?" "Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?" "Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house down if I don't, but other than that ... well, no not especially, why?" They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good, is there anywhere we can talk?" "What?" said Arthur Dent. 
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run 
over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur. 
"We've got to talk," he said urgently. 
"Fine," said Arthur, "talk." 
"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the village." 
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. 
"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my 
house down!" 
Ford glanced at him, puzzled. 
"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked. 
"But I don't want him to!" 
"Ah." 
"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur. 
"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me , I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever 
heard. I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom." 
"But why?" 
"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink." 
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken. He didn't 
realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports 
that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta. 
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: 
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them. 
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song 
"Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old Janx 
Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more 
of that sinful Old Janx Spirit"). 
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour 
spirit into the glass of his opponent , who would then have to drink it. 
The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. And again. 
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to 
depress telepsychic power. 
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, 
which was usually obscenely biological. 
Ford Prefect usually played to lose. 
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all. 
"But what about my house ...?" he asked plaintively. 
Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him. 
"He wants to knock your house down?" 
"Yes, he wants to build ..." 
"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?" 
"Yes, and ..." 
"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse me!" he shouted. 
Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur 
Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He 
was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company. 
"Yes? Hello?" he called. "Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?" 
"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?" 
"Well?" sighed Mr Prosser. 
"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be staying here all day?" 
"So?" 
"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?" 
"Could be, could be ..." 
"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually need him to lie here all the time do you?" 
"What?" 
"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here." 
Mr Prosser thought about this. 
"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need ..." Prosser was worried. He thought that one of them 
wasn't making a lot of sense. 
Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that he's actually here, then he and I could slip off 
down to the pub for half an hour. How does that sound?" 
Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. 
"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to 
reassure. 
"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on," said Ford, "we can always cover up for you 
in return." 
"Thank you very much," said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all, "thank you very 
much, yes, that's very kind ..." He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold 
of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won. 
"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come over here and lie down ..." 
"What?" said Mr Prosser. 
"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. Somebody's got to lie in front of the 
bulldozers haven't they? Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr Dent's house will there?" 
"What?" said Mr Prosser again. 
"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole 
condition that you come and take over from him." 
"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet. 
"You want me," said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, "to come and lie there ..." 
"Yes." 
"In front of the bulldozer?" 
"Yes." 
"Instead of Mr Dent." 
"Yes." 
"In the mud." 
"In, as you say it, the mud." 
As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself 
off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed. 
"In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the pub?" "That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly." 
Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. 
"Promise?" 
"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur. 
"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down." 
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream. 
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He felt that his whole life was 
some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. The 
mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes. 
Ford looked at him severely. 
"And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?" he said. 
"The mere thought," growled Mr Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling himself 
back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind." 
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this , his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head , what a day. What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got 
knocked down or not now. 
Arthur remained very worried. 
"But can we trust him?" he said. 
"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford. 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?" 
"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink." 
Chapter 2 Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. 
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of 
lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. 
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much 
you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards. 
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. 
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says. 
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V , Oh that Santraginean sea water, it 
says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!! 
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is 
lost). 
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have 
died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. 
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady 
odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. 
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep 
into the heart of the drink. 
Sprinkle Zamphuor. 
Add an olive. 
Drink ... but ... very carefully ... 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica. 
"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the 
world's about to end." 
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of treatment, he was a dignified old man. He 
pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the 
window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing. 
So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and started pulling pints. 
He tried again. 
"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?" 
Ford glanced round at him. "No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window. 
"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the barman. "Arsenal without a chance?" 
"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end." 
"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur. "Lucky escape for 
Arsenal if it did." 
Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. 
"No, not really," he said. He frowned. 
The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints," he said. 
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in 
case any of them had heard what was going on. 
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for. 
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of 
mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them. 
"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that would have an Algolian Suntiger get on with 
what it was doing. 
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the change." 
"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir." 
"You've got ten minutes left to spend it." 
The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit. 
"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is going on?" 
"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through." 
"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?" 
The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, "Time is an illusion. 
Lunchtime doubly so." 
"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people 
like you." 
"Drink up." 
"Why three pints all of a sudden?" 
"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it." "Muscle relaxant?" 
"Muscle relaxant." 
Arthur stared into his beer. 
"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always been like this and I've been too 
wrapped up in myself to notice?" 
"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we known each other?" 
"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he said. "Most of it seemed to make some 
sense at the time." 
"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small 
planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?" 
Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way. 
"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why , do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to 
say?" 
Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end. He 
just said: 
"Drink up." 
He added, perfectly factually: 
"The world's about to end." 
Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at 
him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business. 
"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, "I never could get the 
hang of Thursdays." 
Chapter 3 On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing. The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them , which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years. The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb , a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million "pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor , The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in. Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value , you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you , daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with. Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea. "You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur. Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. "Why? What, no ... should I have?" He had given up being surprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer. Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. "Drink up," he urged. 
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the 
pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the 
whisky Ford had eventually bought him. 
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet. 
"What's that?" he yelped. 
"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet." 
"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed. 
"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, drowning his last pint. 
"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to 
the window. 
"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?" 
"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let them have their fun." 
"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the 
same thing. 
"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass. He made 
no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime. 
"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half crazed Visigoths, stop will you!" 
Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts. 
"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so 
kind." 
Ford was very kind , he gave the barman another five-pound note and told him to keep the change. The 
barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary 
sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments 
of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This signal simply 
communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On 
Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn't 
very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great 
stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse. 
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't know 
what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe. 
"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. "You think the 
world's going to end?" 
"Yes," said Ford. 
"But, this afternoon?" 
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest. 
"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would estimate." 
The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn't believe the sensation he 
had just had either. 
"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said. 
"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets. 
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become. 
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their way up to Ford. 
"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over 
our head or something." 
"If you like, yes," said Ford. 
"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back down to his 
whisky. 
"Will that help?" asked the barman. 
"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he said, "I've got to go." With a wave, he left. 
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous 
laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over 
the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute 
and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. 
However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it. The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say: "Last orders, please." The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster. Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it. Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home. 
"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every penny it's got! I'll have you hung, drawn and 
quartered! And whipped! And boiled ... until ... until ... until you've had enough." 
Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast. "And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!" Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. "And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still running, "until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then ..." Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot upwards. "What the hell's that?" he shrieked. Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull. Another one followed and did the same thing only louder. It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense , running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit. Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons. Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going. Everything was ready, everything was prepared. He knew where his towel was. A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the noise. For a while nothing happened. The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. And still nothing happened. Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound. Every hi fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid.range driver in the world quietly turned itself on. Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board. Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message. "People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep. "This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you." The PA died away. Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to. Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said: "There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now." The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space. By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said: "What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout. "Energize the demolition beams." Light poured out into the hatchways. "I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all." It cut off. There was a terrible ghastly silence. There was a terrible ghastly noise. There was a terrible ghastly silence. The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void. Chapter 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun. Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of. Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. The boat sped on. Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret. The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence , in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences. But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy , Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. President? No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least. Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder \footnote{ President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government.} . What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it. He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence. As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing. "Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle. The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore. On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold , mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super.intelligent shade of the color blue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion. There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it. Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns. In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms , but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the bay. Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at. He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves. Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people. The three billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that's what they were for. He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven. A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as anything. Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below. Zaphod smiled, picturing himself. A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one. At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt. To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. The President of the Galaxy had arrived. He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting. "Hi," he said. A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of papier m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it. Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. "Hi," he said again. Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him. "Hi honey," he said to her. She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly , but by this time he was looking at something else. "Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way. Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named , The Heart of Gold. "Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't much else he could say. He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. "Wow." The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff. "That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it." A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned. As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles. Chapter 5 Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects. Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never have survived. The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway. Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitch hikers. Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect \footnote{Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford's father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford's father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.} . He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves. This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon. It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts." Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently. "Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've never been through a matter transference beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit." "Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. "It's dark," he said. "Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark." "No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light." One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn't know about. "Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to some peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked. "Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing out." Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. "If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly, "would I regret it?" Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said. 
"Oh good," said Arthur. 
"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet." 
"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware 
of." 
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed 
again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to 
throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying 
themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. 
"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly. 
"We hitched a lift," said Ford. 
"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green 
bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the 
Basingstoke roundabout?" 
"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling device, the roundabout's at Barnard's 
Star six light years away, but otherwise, that's more or less right." 
"And the bug-eyed monster?" 
"Is green, yes." 
"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?" 
"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. 
"Shade your eyes ..." he said, and turned it on. 
Even Ford was surprised. 
"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying saucer?" 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt 
vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. "Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered the report they'd just received. The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary. Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was grinning like a maniac. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about. Ford and Arthur stared about them. 
"Well, what do you think?" said Ford. 
"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?" 
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear 
that lay around the cramped cabin. 
"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters." 
"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something." 
"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board." 
"I'm confused," said Arthur. 
"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his 
satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. Ford handed the book to Arthur. 
"What is it?" asked Arthur. 
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to 
know about anything. That's its job." 
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. 
"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all 
day." 
"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a 
two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its cover. 
"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the index." 
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface. 
"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His fingers tapped some more keys. "And 
there we are." 
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. 
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the 
same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book said. "Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy , not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled as firelighters. "The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to 
irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. 
"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you." 
Arthur blinked at it. 
"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?" 
"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover. "I'm doing the field 
research for the New Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how the 
Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole." 
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the Dentrassi?" he said. 
"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best drink mixers and they don't give a wet slap 
about anything else. And they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they like the company, 
but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an 
impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a 
day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?" 
Arthur looked lost. 
"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses. 
"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended," said Ford. "I came for a week 
and got stuck for fifteen years." 
"But how did you get there in the first place then?" 
"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser." 
"A teaser?" 
"Yeah." 
"Er, what is ..." 
"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets which 
haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them." 
"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him. "Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant 
back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself. 
"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here?" 
"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth." 
"And what's happened to the Earth?" 
"Ah. It's been demolished." 
"Has it," said Arthur levelly. 
"Yes. It just boiled away into space." 
"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that." 
Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind. 
"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last. 
"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!" 
Ford sprang up. 
"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently. 
"What?" 
"Don't Panic." 
"I'm not panicking!" 
"Yes you are." 
"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?" 
"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this 
fish in your ear." 
"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought. 
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it. 
Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. 
He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and 
the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able 
to see just a small packet of corn flakes. He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe. Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. "Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important." "Im ... important?" "It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy." "You mean that's how the Vogons talk?" "Listen!" "But I can't speak Vogon!" "You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear." Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses. He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English. This is what he heard ... Chapter 6 "Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out a search party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off the ship. If you're very lucky I might read you some of my poetry first. "Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy-two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should have a good time. Message ends." The noise stopped. Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly. "Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one ..." "You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident. No, don't move," he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk." "What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" 
"You ask a glass of water." 
Arthur thought about this. 
"Ford," he said. 
"Yeah?" 
"What's this fish doing in my ear?" 
"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if you like." 
He tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then curled himself up into a foetal ball to 
prepare himself for the jump. 
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind. 
His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. 
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own 
navel. 
They were passing through hyperspace. 
"The Babel fish," said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, "is small, yellow and leech-like, and 
probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish. "Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. "The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.' 
"`But,' says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It 
proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 
"`Oh dear,' says God, `I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic. 
"`Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing. "Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God. "Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of creation." Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed. The Earth. Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab , the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson's Column had gone! Nelson's Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind , his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him. England no longer existed. He'd got that , somehow he'd got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He'd never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald's hamburger. He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother. He jerked himself violently to his feet. "Ford!" Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself. He always found the actual travelling-through-space part of space travel rather trying. "Yeah?" he said. "If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, you must have been gathering material on it." "Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes." "Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see it." "Yeah OK." He passed it over again. Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He pressed the entry for the relevant page. 
The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. 
"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out. 
Ford looked over his shoulder. 
"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the 
triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6." 
Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a moment it still didn't register, then his 
mind nearly blew up. 
"What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless! One word!" 
Ford shrugged. 
"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited amount of space in the book's 
microprocessors," he said, "and no one knew much about the Earth of course." 
"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit." 
"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an 
improvement." 
"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. 
"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough. 
"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur. 
"What was that noise?" hissed Ford. 
"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur. 
"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble." 
"You think we're in trouble!" 
Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet. 
"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur. 
"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford. 
There was a sharp ringing rap on the door. 
"Then who is it?" said Arthur. 
"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space." "And if we're unlucky?" "If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first ..." Chapter 7 Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe. The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness. The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs , strapped in. Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness. The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment , imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers , all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost. Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far and didn't think things were likely to change. The Vogon began to read , a fetid little passage of his own devising. "Oh frettled gruntbuggly ..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's body , this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for. "... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee." "Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. "Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my foonting turlingdromes." His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. "And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!" "Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. Arthur lolled. "Now Earthlings ..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or ..." he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!" He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat and watched them. He did the smile 
again. 
Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned. 
Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it." 
Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him. 
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing. 
"Oh good ..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment. 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective." 
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new concept. Were they 
really going to be able to bareface their way out of this? 
"Yes, do continue ..." invited the Vogon. 
"Oh ... and er ... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued Arthur, "which seemed to counterpoint the ... 
er ... er ..." He floundered. 
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the ... er 
..." He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again. 
"... humanity of the ..." 
"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him. 
"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul," Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, 
"which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other," (he was reaching a triumphant crescendo ...) "and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into ... into ... er ..." (... which suddenly gave out on him.) Ford leaped in with the coup de gr@ce: "Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good." 
The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought no 
, too little too late. His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. 
"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I 
really just want to be loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?" 
Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't we all, deep down, you know ... er ..." 
The Vogon stood up. 
"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless 
exterior into sharp relief. I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to number 
three airlock and throw them out!" 
"What?" shouted Ford. 
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery 
arms. 
"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to write a book." 
"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the first phrase he'd learnt when he 
joined the Vogon Guard Corps. 
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away. 
Arthur stared round him wildly. 
"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I don't want to go to heaven with a 
headache, I'd be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it!" 
The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing deferentially towards his captain's back, 
hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. 
He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses. 
"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor ..." He considered this for a 
moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile. 
"Death's too good for them," he said. 
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under 
rubbery Vogon armpits. 
"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let go of me you brute!" 
The Vogon guard dragged them on. 
"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." He didn't sound hopeful. 
"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard. 
"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if 
you're saying things like that?" 
"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog ... It's now just after four in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!" He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. "Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking." "Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking." "Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. 
"Resistance is useless!" 
"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford. 
"Resistance is useless!" 
"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor's face. A 
thought struck him. 
"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly. 
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face. 
"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?" 
"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing 
people out of spaceships ..." 
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other. His mouth 
slacked. Finally he said, "Well the hours are good ..." 
"They'd have to be," agreed Ford. 
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford. 
"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper. 
"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?" he said. "So the hours are pretty good 
then?" he resumed. 
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths. 
"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except ..." 
he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling , "except some of the shouting I quite like." He 
filled his lungs and bellowed, "Resistance is ..." 
"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I can tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said, 
slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The 
leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all 
presents an interesting challenge?" 
"Er ..." said the guard, "er ... er ... I dunno. I think I just sort of ... do it really. My aunt said that spaceship 
guard was a good career for a young Vogon , you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, the 
mindless tedium ..." 
"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument, "you 
think you've got problems." 
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon guard 
had half-throttled him already and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much. 
"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor lad, his entire life's work is stamping 
around, throwing people off spaceships ..." 
"And shouting," added the guard. 
"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly 
condescension, "... and he doesn't even know why he's doing it!" 
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too 
asphyxicated to speak. 
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. 
"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ..." 
"Good lad!" encouraged Ford. 
"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the alternative?" 
"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course! Tell them," he went on, "you're not going to 
do it anymore." He felt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his 
mind occupied pondering that much. 
"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ..." said the guard, "erm, well that doesn't sound that 
great to me." 
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. 
"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see, there's more to it than that you see ..." 
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners 
to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched. 
"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go 
and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do." 
It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all. 
"Come on now ... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly. 
"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn ..." said Arthur without any clear inflection. "But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!" "Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non.pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know." They had now reached the airlock , a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open. "But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye now." He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and flung 
his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. 
"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you don't know anything about ... here how 
about this?" Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand , he hummed the first 
bar of Beethoven's Fifth. 
"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?" 
"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my aunt." 
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but 
the faint distant hum of the ship's engines. 
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long. 
"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against the curved wall. 
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. He didn't look up. He just lay panting. 
"We're trapped now aren't we?" 
"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped." 
"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something. Perhaps you 
thought of something and didn't notice." 
"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up expectantly. 
"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway." 
He kicked the hatch they'd just been through. 
"But it was a good idea was it?" 
"Oh yes, very neat." 
"What was it?" 
"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is there?" 
"So ... er, what happens next?" "Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds of course ..." said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien. "So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." "Yes," said Ford, "except ... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something 
behind Arthur's line of vision. "What's this switch?" he cried. 
"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round. 
"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all." 
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he left off. 
"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from 
Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my 
mother told me when I was young." 
"Why, what did she tell you?" 
"I don't know, I didn't listen." 
"Oh." Ford carried on humming. 
"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column has gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's 
left is me and the words Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly Harmless. And 
yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well." 
A motor whirred. 
A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty 
blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like 
corks from a toy gun. 
Chapter 8 The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers. The introduction begins like this: "Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen ..." and so on. (After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get a receipt.) To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts. The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination. Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima. For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand years. The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the way. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against. By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with , she went off with a gatecrasher. Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued. Chapter 9 A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason. This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch. A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end. As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of surprise. Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine-struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system. The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was how life began in the Universe. Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement. On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent fish. "There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced through the Third 
Reach of the Unknown, "I told you I'd think of something." 
"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure." 
"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it." 
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like 
mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, 
matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. 
"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were astronomical." 
"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford. 
"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them. 
"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet." 
"No, nor have I," said Arthur. 
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions. 
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise. 
"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at Southend." 
"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford. 
"Why?" 
"Because I thought I must be going mad." 
"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it." 
Ford thought about this. 
"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked. 
"I think so," said Arthur. 
"Well, perhaps we're both going mad." "Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend." 
"Well, do you think this is Southend?" 
"Oh yes." 
"So do I." 
"Therefore we must be mad." 
"Nice day for it." 
"Yes," said a passing maniac. 
"Who was that?" asked Arthur 
"Who , the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?" 
"Yes." 
"I don't know. Just someone." 
"Ah." 
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily 
along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas. "You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is Southend, there's something very odd about it ..." 
"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes 
I thought that was odd too. In fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal 
segments which danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation, "there is 
something altogether very strange going on." 
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road 
for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it. 
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad 
shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl's voice. 
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one 
against and falling," and that was all. 
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a source for the voice but could see 
nothing he could seriously believe in. 
"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur. 
"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a measurement of probability." "Probability? What do you mean?" "Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against. That's pretty improbable you know." A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning. "But what does it mean?" cried Arthur. "What, the custard?" "No, the measurement of probability!" "I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of spaceship." "I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-class compartment." Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges. "Haaaauuurrgghhh ..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. "Southend seems to be melting away ... the stars are swirling ... a dustbowl ... my legs are drifting off into the sunset ... my left arm's come off too." A frightening thought struck him: "Hell," he said, "how am I going to operate my digital watch now?" He wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction. "Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it." Again came the voice. "Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling." Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. "Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on and is there any way of stopping it?" "Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, "you are perfectly safe." "But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!" "It's alright, I've got them back now," said Arthur. "Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," said the voice. "Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, but ..." "Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you ought to be telling us?" The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance. "Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold." The voice continued. "Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against , possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling." The voice cut out. Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. Ford was wildly excited. "Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard rumors about it before! They were all officially denied, but they must have done it! They've built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is ... Arthur? What's happening?" Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely. Arthur looked up. "Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out." Chapter 10 The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research team on Damogran. This, briefly, is the story of its discovery. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood , and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy. Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this , partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind.paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible. Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea ... and turn it on! He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air. It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass. Chapter 11 The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three-dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement. Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship. "Five to one against and falling ..." she said, "four to one against and falling ... three to one ... two ... one ... probability factor of one to one ... we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her microphone off , then turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: "Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon." Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?" Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged. "Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." "Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained Zaphod, "but do you really think it's wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitch hikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus 
several million for good thinking, yeah?" 
He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything important. 
Whatever Zaphod's qualities of mind might include , dash, bravado, conceit , he was mechanically 
inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the 
main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never really understood the 
significance of anything he did. 
"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in open space ... you wouldn't want them to 
have died would you?" 
"Well, you know ... no. Not as such, but ..." 
"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on one side. 
"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later." 
"A second later and they would have been dead." 
"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away." 
"You'd been happy to let them die?" 
"Well, you know, not happy as such, but ..." 
"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't pick them up." 
"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?" 
"The ship did." 
"Huh?" 
"The ship did. All by itself." 
"Huh?" 
"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive." 
"But that's incredible." 
"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable." 
"Er, yeah." 
"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the aliens. They're just a couple of guys I 
expect. I'll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!" 
In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to 
stare through her left shoulder. 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its voice was low and hopeless. 
"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat. 
"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's something to occupy you and keep your mind 
off things." 
"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large mind." 
"Marvin!" warned Trillian. 
"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?" 
"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance." 
With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre , nothing you could actually take offence at , Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human. "Just that?" he said. "Yes," said Trillian firmly. "I won't enjoy it," said Marvin. Zaphod leaped out of his seat. "She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will you?" "Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, "I'll do it." "Good ..." snapped Zaphod, "great ... thank you ..." Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up towards him. "I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically. "No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ..." "I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down." 
"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act as comes naturally and everything will be just 
fine." 
"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin. 
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ... just part of life." "Marvin flashed him an electronic look. "Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life." He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him "I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled Trillian. The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With." The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came." The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. "I think the ship's brand new," said Ford. "How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?" "No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of `the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right." Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. "It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major governments. Wow, this is big league stuff." Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read , clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile. Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook himself. "Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, "they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature." "GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?" "Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities." "Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly." 
A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking 
sound. They span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. 
"What?" they said. 
"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this door," 
he said, stepping through it. The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. "All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it. "Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said. Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned. "Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a 
planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't." 
He turned and walked back to the hated door. 
"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government owns this ship?" 
Marvin ignored him. 
"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness 
it suddenly generates." 
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and Marvin stomped through. 
"Come on," he said. 
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs. 
"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation," said Marvin and trudged 
desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build robots with Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they tried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you?" Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. 
"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down at all am I?" 
"Which government ..." started Ford again. 
"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen." "Stolen?" "Stolen?" mimicked Marvin. "Who by?" asked Ford. "Zaphod Beeblebrox." Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles. "Zaphod Beeblebrox ...?" he said weakly. "Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life." "No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are you alright?" Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he said. Chapter 12 A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive , you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. "... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock," squawked a voice, "and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere ... and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is ... has the big Z finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Wort Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time ... has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt ..." The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Vell, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?" but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian , she had thrown the pencil. "Hey," he said, what do you do that for?" Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures. 
"I've just thought of something," she said. 
"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?" 
"You hear enough about yourself as it is." 
"I'm very insecure. We know that." 
"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important." + "If there's anything more important than my 
ego around, I want it caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed. 
"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys ..." 
"What couple of guys?" 
"The couple of guys we picked up." 
"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys." 
"We picked them up in sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha." 
"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked. 
Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?" 
"Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha?" 
"Well?" said Trillian. 
"Er ... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod. 
"Which one?" 
"Any one." 
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to 
distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so , but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way. "There," she pointed, "right there." "Hey ... Yeah!" said Zaphod. 
"Well?" she said. 
"Well what?" 
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head. She said, very calmly, 
"It's the same sector you originally picked me up in." 
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen. 
"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horsehead 
Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean that's nowhere." 
She ignored this. 
"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to me yourself. We pass through every point in 
the Universe, you know that." 
"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?" 
"Yes." 
"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the Universe to choose from? That's just too ... I 
want to work this out. Computer!" 
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which controlled and permeated every particle 
of the ship switched into communication mode. 
"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. 
The ticker tape said, Hi there! 
"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it. 
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent. 
"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it." 
"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of paper." 
"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time, "I understand. 
If you ever want ..." 
"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to Trillian at the console. 
"OK, OK ..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again. 
Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in 
front of them. 
"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what the Improbability of their rescue was?" "Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven 
hundred and nine to one against." 
"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys." 
"Yes." 
"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up ..." 
Trillian punched up the figures. They showed tow-to-the power-of-Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number 
that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics). 
"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle. 
"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. 
"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something pretty improbable has got to show 
up on the balance sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum." 
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away. 
"Bat's dots, I can't work it out." 
"Well?" 
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth. 
"OK," he said. "Computer!" 
The voice circuits sprang to life again. 
"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer 
and nicer ..." 
"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me." 
"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability forecast based on ..." 
"Improbability data, yeah." 
"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little notion. Did you realize that most people's lives 
are governed by telephone numbers?" 
A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the other one. 
"Have you flipped?" he said. 
"No, but you will when I tell you that ..." 
Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen. "Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone number?" 
Numbers flashed up on the screen. 
The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. 
"What I was about to say was that ..." 
"Don't bother please," said Trillian. 
"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod. 
"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens , they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched 
robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?" 
Chapter 13 Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. 
"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side ..." 
"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?" 
"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens." 
"I can imagine." 
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. "Well well well," he kept saying to himself, 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox ..." 
Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand. 
"You know what's happened now of course?" 
"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know. 
"We've arrived at another of those doors." 
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin eyed it suspiciously. 
"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?" 
"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance to the bridge. I was told to take you to 
the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't 
wonder." 
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid 
open. 
"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy." Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground. 
"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does." 
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their 
shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin's voice again. 
"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just 
fall apart where I'm standing?" 
"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice. 
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. 
"What's ...?" 
"Shhh," said Ford, "come in." 
He stepped through into the bridge. 
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a 
control console picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while. The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in." Ford was not going to be outcooled. 
"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've 
stolen." 
Arthur goggled at him. 
"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod. 
"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's ..." he paused, and decided to do the introductions the other way 
round. 
"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I saved him when his planet blew up." 
"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His right-hand head looked round casually, 
said "hi" and went back to having his teeth picked. 
Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb ..." 
"We've met," said Arthur sharply. 
When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. "Err ... what?" 
"I said we've met." 
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply. 
"Hey ... er, have we? Hey ... er ..." 
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt he was back on home ground he 
suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about 
the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking. 
"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you 
know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon." 
"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox -or should I say ... Phil?" 
"What!" shouted Ford. 
"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory for species." 
"It was at a party," pursued Arthur. 
"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod. 
"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford. 
Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth ... England ..." 
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile. 
"London," insisted Arthur, "Islington." 
"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party." 
This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" 
he said to Zaphod. "You don't mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?" 
"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way 
somewhere ..." 
"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!" 
"Well I didn't know that did I?" 
"But what were you doing there?" 
"Looking about, you know." 
"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, "a fancy dress party ..." 
"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford. 
"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl ... oh well, look it doesn't matter now. The whole place has 
gone up in smoke anyway ..." 
"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford. "Who was the lady?" 
"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her. I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she 
was something though. Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet." I never saw her again." "Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford. "Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He only had the two arms and the one 
head and he called himself Phil, but ..." 
"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet," said Trillian wandering into sight at the 
other end of the bridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and 
then turned her attention to the ship's controls again. 
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some 
words. 
"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?" 
"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in Maths and another in astrophysics 
what else was there to do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday." 
"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum now complete." 
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. 
"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive?" 
"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said. 
Chapter 14 The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of physics , as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules. As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which contained her last and only links with Earth , two white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planet's destruction. It seemed remote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about. Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see. Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which. Arthur slept: he was terribly tired. There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open. "Zaphod ...?" "Yeah?" "I think we just found what you came to look for." "Hey, yeah?" Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge. As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments. "See? The ship's about to move into orbit," Trillian was saying. "There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you predicted." Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. "Ford!" he hissed. "Hey, come and take a look at this." Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flashing over a screen. "You recognize those Galactic coordinates?" said Zaphod. "No." "I'll give you a clue. Computer!" 
"Hi gang!" enthused the computer. "This is getting real sociable isn't it?" 
"Shut up," said Zaphod, "and show up the screens." 
Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes 
that stared up at the external monitor screens. 
There was absolutely nothing on them. 
"Recognize that?" whispered Zaphod. 
Ford frowned. 
"Er, no," he said. 
"What do you see?" 
"Nothing." 
"Recognize it?" 
"What are you talking about?" 
"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud." 
"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?" 
"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a dark screen." 
"Very good." 
Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so. 
"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!" 
"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?" said Ford. 
"What would you reckon to find here?" urged Zaphod. 
"Nothing." 
"No stars? No planets?" 
"No." 
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod, "rotate angle of vision through one-eighty degrees and don't talk about it!" 
For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one , a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture , a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side of the planet. "I've found it!" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. "I've found it!" Ford stared at it in astonishment. "What is it?" he said. "That ..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever existed." Chapter 15 (Excerpt from The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, Section 5a, Entry: Magrathea) Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free. Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before , and thus was the Empire forged. Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor , at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they'd settled on , none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink. And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets , gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes , all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect. But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned political economy. Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend. In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it. Chapter 16 Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. Ford was waving his arms about. "You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids 
about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it's ..." 
"And that's what we are currently in orbit around," insisted Zaphod. 
"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around," said Ford, "but this ship ..." 
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 
"Oh no ..." 
"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great guys, and I know I'm just 
going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me." 
Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on in but keep quiet. 
"Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us again what our present trajectory is." 
"A real pleasure feller," it burbled, "we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around 
the legendary planet of Magrathea." 
"Proving nothing," said Ford. "I wouldn't trust that computer to speak my weight." 
"I can do that for you, sure," enthused the computer, punching out more tickertape. "I can even work out 
you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help." 
Trillian interrupted. 
"Zaphod," she said, "any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet," adding, 
"whatever it turns out to be." 
"Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it would be isn't it?" 
"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone, it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea 
from any other lump of cold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it." 
"OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least give our eyes a good time. Computer!" 
"Hi there! What can I ..." 
"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again." 
A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens , the planet rolling away beneath them. 
They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with excitement. 
"We are now traversing the night side ..." he said in a hushed voice. The planet rolled on. 
"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us ..." he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea! "In a few seconds," he continued, "we should see ... there!" The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy. Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. "The fires of dawn ... !" breathed Zaphod. "The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm ... !" "Or whatever," said Ford quietly. "Soulianis and Rahm!" insisted Zaphod. The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much. As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. "I only know what Zaphod's told me," she whispered. "Apparently Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets." Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. "Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked. More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day , grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon , ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities , but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire. The planet's surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century. Clearly, it was very very old. A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. "Well, even supposing it is ..." "It is," said Zaphod. 
"Which it isn't," continued Ford. "What do you want with it anyway? There's nothing there." 
"Not on the surface," said Zaphod. 
"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it 
all. What are you after?" 
One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but 
it wasn't looking at anything very much. 
"Well," said Zaphod airily, "it's partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the 
fame and the money ..." 
Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he 
was there at all. 
"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian shivering. 
"Ah, take no notice," said Zaphod, "with half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it 
somewhere it can afford to look frumpy." 
Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, 
even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth 
were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now. He shrugged. 
"I think it's just a dead planet," he said. 
"The suspense is killing me," said Arthur testily. 
Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order 
that this situation should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in 
advance. 
The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea. 
The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result 
merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, and 
the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale. 
In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning 
whose upper arm sustained the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is 
of no significance whatsoever. 
Chapter 17 After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system. Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. "Is it safe?" he said. "Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now." At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge , a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It 
preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to you ..." 
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. 
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 
"Hi there!" 
"What the photon is it?" 
"Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast at us." 
"A what? A recording?" 
"Shush!" said Ford. "It's carrying on." 
The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace. 
"This is a recorded announcement," it said, "as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment. The commercial 
council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit ..." 
("A voice from ancient Magrathea!" shouted Zaphod. "OK, OK," said Ford.) 
"... but regrets," continued the voice, "that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. Thank you. 
If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly 
speak when you hear the tone." 
A short buzz followed, then silence. 
"They want to get rid of us," said Trillian nervously. "What do we do?" 
"It's just a recording," said Zaphod. "We keep going. Got that, computer?" 
"I got it," said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed. 
They waited. After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice. 
"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all 
fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from 
all that's best in contemporary geography." The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. "Meanwhile 
we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave. Now." 
Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. 
"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?" he suggested. 
"Shhh!" said Zaphod. "There's absolutely nothing to be worried about." 
"Then why's everyone so tense?" 
"They're just interested!" shouted Zaphod. "Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare 
for landing." 
This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly cold. 
"It is most gratifying," it said, "that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would 
like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives ... thank you." The voice snapped off. 
"Oh," said Trillian. 
"Er ..." said Arthur. 
"Well?" said Ford. 
"Look," said Zaphod, "will you get it into your heads? That's just a recorded message. It's millions of years 
old. It doesn't apply to us, get it?" 
"What," said Trillian quietly, "about the missiles?" 
"Missiles? Don't make me laugh." 
Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. Clear in the distance behind them 
two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus -two massively real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was shocking. "I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us," said Ford. 
Zaphod stared at them in astonishment. + "Hey this is terrific!" he said. "Someone down there is trying to 
kill us!" 
"Terrific," said Arthur. 
"But don't you see what this means?" 
"Yes. We're going to die." 
"Yes, but apart from that." 
"Apart from that?" 
"It means we must be on to something!" 
"How soon can we get off it?" 
Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger. They had swung round now on 
to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. 
"As a matter of interest," said Trillian, "what are we going to do?" 
"Just keep cool," said Zaphod. 
"Is that all?" shouted Arthur. 
"No, we're also going to ... er ... take evasive action!" said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic. 
"Computer, what evasive action can we take?" 
"Er, none I'm afraid, guys," said the computer. 
"... or something," said Zaphod, "... er ..." he said. 
"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system," explained the computer brightly, "impact 
minus forty-five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax." 
Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously. "Right!" he said. "Er ... we've got 
to get manual control of this ship." 
"Can you fly her?" asked Ford pleasantly. 
"No, can you?" 
"No." 
"Trillian, can you?" 
"No." 
"Fine," said Zaphod, relaxing. "We'll do it together." 
"I can't either," said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself. 
"I'd guessed that," said Zaphod. "OK computer, I want full manual control now." 
"You got it," said the computer. Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these controls had never been used before. Zaphod stared at them wildly. "OK, Ford," he said, "full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or something ..." "Good luck guys," chirped the computer, "impact minus thirty seconds ..." Ford leapt to the controls , only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them and the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles. Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. "Impact minus twenty seconds, guys ..." said the computer. "Then turn the bloody engines back on!" bawled Zaphod. "OK, sure thing, guys," said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again. The computer started to sing. "When you walk through the storm ..." it whined nasally, "hold your head up high ..." Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. "And don't ... be afraid ... of the dark!" Eddie wailed. The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it 
was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. 
"At the end of the storm ..." crooned Eddie. 
The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship. 
"... is a golden sky ..." 
But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the 
erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it. 
"And the sweet silver songs of the lark ... Revised impact time fifteen seconds fellas ... Walk on through 
the wind ..." 
The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit. + "This is it," said Arthur 
watching them. "We are now quite definitely going to die aren't we?" 
"I wish you'd stop saying that," shouted Ford. 
"Well we are aren't we?" 
"Yes." 
"Walk on through the rain ..." sang Eddie. 
A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. 
"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?" he said. "We could probably reach that." 
"What are you crazy?" said Zaphod. "Without proper programming anything could happen." 
"Does that matter at this stage?" shouted Arthur. 
"Though your dreams be tossed and blown ..." sand Eddie. 
Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve 
of the wall met the ceiling. 
"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart ..." 
"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability Drive?" shouted Trillian. 
"And you'll never walk alone ... Impact minus five seconds, it's been great knowing you guys, God bless 
... You'll ne ... ver ... walk ... alone!" 
"I said," yelled Trillian, "does anyone know ..." 
The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of noise and light. 
Chapter 18 And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful. Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What the hell happened?" "Well I was just saying," said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, "there's this Improbability Drive switch over here ..." he waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. "But where are we?" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand. "Exactly where we were, I think ..." said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them. Zaphod leapt out of his seat. "Then what's happened to the missiles?" he said. A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. "They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale ..." "At an Improbability Factor," cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a bit, "of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one hundred and twenty-eight to one against." Zaphod stared at Arthur. "Did you think of that, Earthman?" he demanded. "Well," said Arthur, "all I did was ..." "That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. + Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that?" "Oh," said Arthur, "well, it was nothing really ..." "Was it?" said Zaphod. "Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer, take us in to land." "But ..." "I said forget it." Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been 
called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. 
And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little 
time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a 
whale any more. 
This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it. 
Ah ... ! What's happening? it thought. 
Er, excuse me, who am I? 
Hello? 
Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? 
What do I mean by who am I? 
Calm down, get a grip now ... oh! this is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of ... yawning, 
tingling sensation in my ... my ... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach. Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do ... perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what it's for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What's this thing? This ... let's call it a tail , yeah, tail. Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good can't I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now -have I built up any coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite 
dizzy with anticipation ... 
Or is it the wind? 
There really is a lot of that now isn't it? 
And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat 
and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like ... ow ... ound ... round ... ground! That's it! That's a 
good name , ground! 
I wonder if it will be friends with me? 
And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. 
Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now. Chapter 19 "Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree. 
Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted 
landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed. 
"Oh, the Paranoid Android," he said. "Yeah, we'll take him." 
"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?" 
"You think you've got problems," said Marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, "what are 
you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level." Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. 
"My white mice have escaped!" she said. 
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod's faces. 
"Nuts to your white mice," he said. 
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. 
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that 
human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second. "Good afternoon boys." 
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the 
crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface. 
They looked at each other in puzzlement. 
"It's the computer," explained Zaphod. "I discovered it had an emergency back-up personality that I 
thought might work out better." 
"Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet," continued Eddie's new voice, "so I 
want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters." 
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch. 
"I'm sorry," he said, "I think we might be better off with a slide rule." 
"Right!" snapped the computer. "Who said that?" "Will you open the exit hatch please, computer?" said Zaphod trying not to get angry. 
"Not until whoever said that owns up," urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed. 
"Oh God," muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten. He was desperately 
worried that one day sentinent life forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could humans 
demonstrate their independence of computers. 
"Come on," said Eddie sternly. 
"Computer ..." began Zaphod ... 
"I'm waiting," interrupted Eddie. "I can wait all day if necessary ..." "Computer ..." said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, "if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?" Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this. Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the 
equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ... 
Finally Eddie said quietly, "I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at," and 
the hatchway opened. 
An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the 
barren dust of Magrathea. 
"It'll all end in tears, I know it," shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again. 
A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a command that caught him 
entirely by surprise. 
Chapter 20 Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was very cold. Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind. "It's fantastic ..." he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere. "Desolate hole if you ask me," said Ford. "I could have more fun in a cat litter." He felt a mounting 
irritation. Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy , didn't he just have to turn up at a 
dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hot dog stand in evidence. He stooped 
down and picked up a cold clot of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of 
light years to look at. 
"No," insisted Arthur, "don't you understand, this is the first time I've actually stood on the surface of 
another planet ... a whole alien world ...! Pity it's such a dump though." 
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected 
movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the 
ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. 
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of 
ground and waving to them to come and join him. 
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish 
atmosphere and the wind. 
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular , a 
crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was 
spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery. 
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat. 
At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod. 
"Look," he said, pointing into the crater. 
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn't lived long enough to be 
disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's 
throat. 
"I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it?" murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn't. 
"Come," said Zaphod and started back down into the crater. 
"What, down there?" said Trillian with severe distaste. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "come on, I've got something to show you." 
"We can see it," said Trillian. 
"Not that," said Zaphod, "something else. Come on." 
They all hesitated. 
"Come on," insisted Zaphod, "I've found a way in." 
"In?" said Arthur in horror. 
"Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go. Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself ..." Marvin started his ironical humming again. Zaphod hit him and he shut up. With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard 
not to look at its unfortunate creator. 
"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it." 
The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages, now 
largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of 
them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod 
shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom. "According to the legends," he said, "the Magratheans lived most of their lives underground." "Why's that?" said Arthur. "Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated?" "No, I don't think so," said Zaphod. "I think they just didn't like it very much." "Are you sure you know what you're doing?" said Trillian peering nervously into the darkness. "We've been attacked once already you know." "Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Er, hey Earthman ..." "Arthur," said Arthur. "Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway. OK?" "Guard?" said Arthur. "What from? You just said there's no one here." "Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?" said Zaphod. "Whose? Yours or mine?" "Good lad. OK, here we go." Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford. "Well I hope you all have a really miserable time," complained Arthur. "Don't worry," Marvin assured him, "they will." In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good 
place to stamp around in. 
Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off. 
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding 
purposefully. He flung the torch beam around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the 
touch, the air thick with decay. 
"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "An inhabited planet. Magrathea," and he strode on through the dirt 
and debris that littered the tile floor. 
Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid. 
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics , simple angular patterns in bright 
colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to 
Zaphod. 
"Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?" 
"I think they're just strange symbols of some kind," said Zaphod, hardly glancing back. 
Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. 
From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to 
be full of derelict computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed. 
"Look," said Ford, "you reckon this is Magrathea ..." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and we heard the voice, right?" 
"OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea , for the moment. What you have so far said nothing 
about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You didn't just look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure." 
"Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy." 
"And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?" 
"I stole it to look for a lot of things." 
"A lot of things?" said Ford in surprise. "Like what?" 
"I don't know." 
"What?" 
"I don't know what I'm looking for." 
"Why not?" 
"Because ... because ... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn't be able to look for them." 
"What, are you crazy?" "It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet," said Zaphod quietly. "I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are not good." For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry. "Listen old friend, if you want to ..." started Ford eventually. "No, wait ... I'll tell you something," said Zaphod. "I freewheel a lot. I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I'll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it's easy. I decide to steal this ship. I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out. It's like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop and think , why did I want to do something? , how did I work out how to do it? , I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it. Like I have now. It's a big effort to talk about it." Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he frowned and said, "Last night I was worrying about this again. About the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly. Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn't use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check. "I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening test on both my heads , all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because I'd given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter. You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?" Ford nodded. "And there it was," said Zaphod, "clear as day. A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum." Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white. "Somebody did that to you?" whispered Ford. "Yeah." "But have you any idea who? Or why?" "Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was." "You know? How do you know?" "Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. They left them there for me to see." Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl. "Initials? Burnt into your brain?" "Yeah." "Well, what were they, for God's sake?" Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he looked away. "Z.B.," he said. At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber. "I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out. Chapter 21 On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time. One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years. There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life. And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public. When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro business. Arthur read this, and put the book down. The robot still sat there, completely inert. Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked around the crater. He watched two suns set 
magnificently over Magrathea. 
He went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is 
better to talk to than nobody. 
"Night's falling," he said. "Look robot, the stars are coming out." 
From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were 
there to be seen. 
The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. 
"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?" 
"But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams ... the two suns! It was like 
mountains of fire boiling into space." 
"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish." 
"We only ever had the one sun at home," persevered Arthur, "I came from a planet called Earth you 
know." 
"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds awful." 
"Ah no, it was a beautiful place." 
"Did it have oceans?" 
"Oh yes," said Arthur with a sigh, "great wide rolling blue oceans ..." 
"Can't bear oceans," said Marvin. 
"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?" 
"Hate them," said Marvin. "Where are you going?" 
Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again. 
"I think I'll just take another walk," he said. 
"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety-seven thousand million sheep before 
falling asleep again a second later. 
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of the crater. Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him. Chapter 22 He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise. Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind , a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it. The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed. 
"You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet," he said. 
"Who ... who are you?" stammered Arthur. 
The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face. 
"My name is not important," he said. 
He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn't have to 
rush at. Arthur felt awkward. 
"I ... er ... you startled me ..." he said, lamely. 
The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows. 
"Hmmmm?" he said. 
"I said you startled me." 
"Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you." 
Arthur frowned at him. "But you shot at us! There were missiles ..." he said. 
The man chuckled slightly. 
"An automatic system," he said and gave a small sigh. "Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the 
planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take 
the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony." 
He looked gravely at Arthur and said, "I'm a great fan of science you know." 
"Oh ... er, really?" said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's curious, kindly manner disconcerting. 
"Oh, yes," said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. "Ah," said Arthur, "er ..." He had an odd felling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again. "You seem ill at ease," said the old man with polite concern. "Er, no ... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren't really expecting to find anybody about in fact. I sort of 
gathered that you were all dead or something ..." 
"Dead?" said the old man. "Good gracious no, we have but slept." 
"Slept?" said Arthur incredulously. 
"Yes, through the economic recession you see," said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether 
Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not. 
"Er, economic recession?" 
"Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-made 
planets are something of a luxury commodity you see ..." 
He paused and looked at Arthur. 
"You know we built planets do you?" he asked solemnly. 
"Well yes," said Arthur, "I'd sort of gathered ..." 
"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, "doing the coastlines was 
always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords ... so anyway," he said trying to find his thread again, "the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over." The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. "The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices you see, so that we'd all be revived 
when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services." 
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. 
"That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it?" 
"Is it?" asked the old man mildly. "I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of touch." 
He pointed down into the crater. 
"Is that robot yours?" he said. 
"No," came a thin metallic voice from the crater, "I'm mine." 
"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of electronic sulking machine." "Bring it," said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn't. "On second thoughts," said the old man, "leave it here. You must come with me. Great things are afoot." He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark. Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and 
trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself. 
"Come," called the old man, "come now or you will be late." 
"Late?" said Arthur. "What for?" 
"What is your name, human?" 
"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur. 
"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's a sort of threat you see." Another 
wistful look came into his tired old eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can 
be very effective." 
Arthur blinked at him. 
"What an extraordinary person," he muttered to himself. 
"I beg your pardon?" said the old man. 
"Oh nothing, I'm sorry," said Arthur in embarrassment. "Alright, where do we go?" 
"In my aircar," said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to 
them. "We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its 
five-million-year slumber. Magrathea awakes." 
Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The strangeness of it, the silent 
bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him. 
He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel. 
"Excuse me," he said to him, "what is your name by the way?" 
"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. "My 
name," he said, "... is Slartibartfast." 
Arthur practically choked. 
"I beg your pardon?" he spluttered. 
"Slartibartfast," repeated the old man quietly. 
"Slartibartfast?" The old man looked at him gravely. "I said it wasn't important," he said. The aircar sailed through the night. Chapter 23 It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much , the wheel, New York, wars and so on , whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man , for precisely the same reasons. Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived. The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double.backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures' plans. Chapter 24 Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It sped swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that. Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all. Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened. They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour. He closed his eyes in terror. After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultra violet. Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. "Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea." "How did you know I was an Earthman?" demanded Arthur. "These things will become clear to you," said the old man gently, "at least," he added with slight doubt in his voice, "clearer than they are at the moment." He continued: "I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too ... large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you." Arthur made nervous noises. Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. "It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight." The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. It wasn't infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity , distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself. Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. The wall. The wall defied the imagination , seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man. The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light. "Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our factory floor." Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. "This," said Slartibartfast, "is where we make most of our planets you see." "You mean," said Arthur, trying to form the words, "you mean you're starting it all up again now?" "No no, good heavens no," exclaimed the old man, "no, the Galaxy isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very ... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you ... there in the distance in front of us." Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put one's finger on. At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense. Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction. The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. "The Earth ..." whispered Arthur. "Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully. "We're making a copy from our original blueprints." There was a pause. "Are you trying to tell me," said Arthur, slowly and with control, "that you originally ... made the Earth?" "Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever go to a place ... I think it was called Norway?" "No," said Arthur, "no, I didn't." "Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its destruction." "You were upset!" "Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much. It was a quite shocking cock-up." 
"Huh?" said Arthur. 
"The mice were furious." 
"The mice were furious?" 
"Oh yes," said the old man mildly. 
"Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but ..." 
"Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they?" 
"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?" 
For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried patiently to explain. 
"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five 
minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one." 
Only one word registered with Arthur. 
"Mice?" he said. 
"Indeed Earthman." 
"Look, sorry , are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women 
standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?" 
Slartibartfast coughed politely. 
"Earthman," he said, "it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech. Remember I have been asleep 
inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front." The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. 
"They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid." 
Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. 
"Ah no," he said, "I see the source of the misunderstanding now. No, look you see, what happened was 
that we used to do experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own ..." Arthur's voice tailed off. "Such subtlety ..." said Slartibartfast, "one has to admire it." "What?" said Arthur. "How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, , if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous." He paused for effect. "You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year research programme ... "Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time." "Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems." Chapter 25 There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches? Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all. And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. It was the size of a small city. Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square. On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-bound notebooks. Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, 
Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel. 
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode. After a pause it 
spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep. 
It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe 
of Time and Space have been called into existence?" 
Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. 
"Your task, O Computer ..." began Fook. 
"No, wait a minute, this isn't right," said Lunkwill, worried. "We distinctly designed this computer to be the 
greatest one ever and we're not making do with second best. Deep Thought," he addressed the 
computer, "are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time?" 
"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, "and such I am." 
Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill cleared his throat. 
"There must be some mistake," he said, "are you not a greatest computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain 
which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?" 
"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus  
mention it not." 
"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star 
Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single 
dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?" 
"A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask this of me who have contemplated 
the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff." 
The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. 
"But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron 
Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable?" 
"The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, 
"could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey , but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards." "Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?" 
"There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones. "I am simply the second 
greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time." 
"But the second?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the second? You're surely not thinking of 
the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the ..." 
Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console. 
"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the 
computer that is to come after me!" 
Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered, "I think this is getting needlessly 
messianic." 
"You know nothing of future time," pronounced Deep Thought, "and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design." Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill. "Can we get on and ask the question?" he said. Lunkwill motioned him to wait. "What computer is this of which you speak?" he asked. "I will speak of it no further in this present time," said Deep Thought. "Now. Ask what else of me you will 
that I may function. Speak." 
They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. 
"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to 
tell us ..." he paused, "... the Answer!" 
"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?" 
"Life!" urged Fook. 
"The Universe!" said Lunkwill. 
"Everything!" they said in chorus. 
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. 
"Tricky," he said finally. 
"But can you do it?" 
Again, a significant pause. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it." 
"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement." 
"A simple answer?" added Lunkwill. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll 
have to think about it." 
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. "We demand admission!" shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. 
"Come on," shouted the older one, "you can't keep us out!" He pushed a junior programmer back through 
the door. 
"We demand that you can't keep us out!" bawled the younger one, though he was now firmly inside the 
room and no further attempts were being made to stop him. 
"Who are you?" said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. "What do you want?" 
"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. 
"And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one. 
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. "It's alright," he explained angrily, "you don't need to demand that." 
"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, 
that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!" 
"No we don't!" exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. "That is precisely what we don't demand!" 
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't demand solid facts! What we demand is a 
total absence of solid facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!" 
"But who the devil are you?" exclaimed an outraged Fook. 
"We," said Majikthise, "are Philosophers." 
"Though we may not be," said Vroomfondel waving a warning finger at the programmers. 
"Yes we are," insisted Majikthise. "We are quite definitely here as representatives of the Amalgamated 
Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, 
and we want it off now!" 
"What's the problem?" said Lunkwill. 
"I'll tell you what the problem is mate," said Majikthise, "demarcation, that's the problem!" 
"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may not be the problem!" "You just let the machines get on with the adding up," warned Majikthise, "and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we? I mean what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next morning?" "That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!" Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room. 
"Might I make an observation at this point?" inquired Deep Thought. 
"We'll go on strike!" yelled Vroomfondel. 
"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands!" 
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units, mounted in sedately 
carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little more 
power. "All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything -" he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before continuing more quietly, "but the programme will take me a little while to run." Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. 
"How long?" he said. 
"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought. 
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other. 
"Seven and a half million years ...!" they cried in chorus. 
"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about it, didn't I? And it occurs to me that running 
a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?" The two philosophers gaped at him. "Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think 
of things like that?" 
"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains must be too highly trained Majikthise." 
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest 
dreams. 
Chapter 26 "Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the salient points of the story to him, "but I don't understand what all this has got to do with the Earth and mice and things." "That is but the first half of the story Earthman," said the old man. "If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's only half completed I'm afraid , we haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and ..." "No thank you," said Arthur, "it wouldn't be quite the same." "No," said Slartibartfast, "it won't be," and he turned the aircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall. Chapter 27 Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. "Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life-support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know. Look why don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?" He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus. "It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus," explained the old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "Here," he said, "hold these," and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur. The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear , many were cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air. Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for everyone's attention. A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy. "O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!" he cried out. "Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known ... The Time of Waiting is over!" Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air. "Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of the Answer!" Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd. "Never again," cried the man, "never again will we wake up in the morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!" As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd. He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it. No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat. The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday. Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited. "The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck. "Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak." "An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles. "We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the great question of Life ...!" "The Universe ...!" said Loonquawl. "And Everything ...!" "Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!" There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel. "Good morning," said Deep Thought at last. "Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, "do you have ... er, that is ..." "An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. I have." The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain. "There really is one?" breathed Phouchg. "There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought. "To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?" "Yes." Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children. "And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl. "I am." "Now?" "Now," said Deep Thought. They both licked their dry lips. "Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it." "Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!" "Now?" inquired Deep Thought. "Yes! Now ..." 
"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was 
unbearable. 
"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought. 
"Tell us!" 
"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question ..." "Yes ...!" "Of Life, the Universe and Everything ..." said Deep Thought. 
"Yes ...!" 
"Is ..." said Deep Thought, and paused. 
"Yes ...!" 
"Is ..." 
"Yes ...!!!...?" 
"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm. 
Chapter 28 It was a long time before anyone spoke. 
Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square 
outside. 
"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered. 
"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly. 
"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?" 
"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the 
problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is." 
"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!" howled 
Loonquawl. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "but what actually is it?" 
A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other. 
"Well, you know, it's just Everything ... Everything ..." offered Phouchg weakly. 
"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the 
answer means." 
"Oh terrific," muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear. 
"Look, alright, alright," said Loonquawl, "can you just please tell us the Question?" 
"The Ultimate Question?" 
"Yes!" "Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?" 
"Yes!" 
Deep Thought pondered this for a moment. 
"Tricky," he said. 
"But can you do it?" cried Loonquawl. 
Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. 
Finally: "No," he said firmly. 
Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair. 
"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought. 
They both looked up sharply. 
"Who?" "Tell us!" 
Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself 
moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of 
whoever had made the recording he assumed. "I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate , and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called ... The Earth." Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought. 
"What a dull name," he said and great incisions appeared down the length of his body. Loonquawl too 
suddenly sustained horrific gashed from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls 
flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling ... 
Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires. 
"End of the tape," he explained. 
Chapter 29 "Zaphod! Wake up!" "Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?" "Hey come on, wake up." 
"Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah?" muttered Zaphod and rolled away from the voice back to 
sleep. 
"Do you want me to kick you?" said Ford. 
"Would it give you a lot of pleasure?" said Zaphod, blearily. 
"No." 
"Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me." Zaphod curled himself up. 
"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, "two windpipes." 
"And stop talking," said Zaphod, "it's hard enough trying to sleep anyway. What's the matter with the 
ground? It's all cold and hard." 
"It's gold," said Ford. 
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon, because that was 
how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed like ... it's impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does. "Who put all that there?" yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed. 
"Don't get excited," said Ford, "it's only a catalogue." 
"A who?" 
"A catalogue," said Trillian, "an illusion." 
"How can you say that?" cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground. He 
poked it and prodded it with his fingernail. It was very heavy and very slightly soft , he could mark it with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. "Trillian and I came round a while ago," said Ford. "We shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape." Zaphod stared at him bitterly. "Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's." 
He sat down in a huff. 
"What's that series of valleys over there?" he said. 
"Hallmark," said Ford. "We had a look." 
"We didn't wake you earlier," said Trillian. "The last planet was knee deep in fish." 
"Fish?" 
"Some people like the oddest things." 
"And before that," said Ford, "we had platinum. Bit dull. We thought you'd like to see this one though." 
Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. 
"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly. 
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered and changed, and when they looked 
around again so had the land. 
As with one voice they all went, "Yuch." 
The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles  
presumably terribly precious stones. The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red 
peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles. 
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, 
Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud. 
And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes. 
In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows. 
"Ow!" said Zaphod. "My brains!" 
"You want to talk about it?" said Ford. 
"Yeah, OK," said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around 
them. 
"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did it. And I did it in such a way that it 
wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it myself. 
Pretty crazy, right?" 
The other two nodded in agreement. 
"So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not 
even myself? And the answer is I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?" "Yeah," said Ford, "he was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he'd ever met." "What's all this?" said Trillian. "Ancient history," said Ford, "when we were kids together on Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. "One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri-jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn't want him coming back with fake evidence. So what happens? We got in his tri-jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter I still don't know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a year's pocket money. For what? Conkers." "The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx," said Zaphod. "He gave us food, booze , stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy , lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool guy. Went on to become President of the Galaxy." Zaphod paused. The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition. "Ford," said Zaphod quietly. "Yeah?" "Just before Yooden died he came to see me." "What? You never told me." "No." "What did he say? What did he come to see you about?" "He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it." "His idea?" "Yeah," said Zaphod, "and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony." Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter. "Are you telling me," he said, "that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?" "That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls. "But why?" said Ford. "What's so important about having it?" "Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think if I'd consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away." "So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you?" 
"He was a hell of a talker." 
"Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know." 
Zaphod shrugged. 
"I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?" asked Ford. 
Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds. 
"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still," he added on further 
reflection, "I can understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat." 
A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved 
itself again. 
They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables and design awards. 
A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. 
"The mice will see you now," he said. 
Chapter 30 "So there you have it," said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study. He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over. "Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it." "And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly. "Yes," said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. "Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten million years, Earthman ... can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time. Gone." He paused. "Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added. "You know," said Arthur thoughtfully, "all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was." "No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that." "Everyone?" said Arthur. "Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere 
outside the Universe we know ..." 
"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. "Perhaps I'm old and tired," he 
continued, "but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly 
remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at 
me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway." 
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a 
model of Norway moulded into it. 
"Where's the sense in that?" he said. "None that I've been able to make out. I've been doing fjords in all 
my life. For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award." 
He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it 
didn't land on something soft. 
"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to do and of course I'm doing it with all 
fjords again because I happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely 
baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me it's not equatorial enough. Equatorial!" He gave a hollow 
laugh. "What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather be 
happy than right any day." 
"And are you?" 
"No. That's where it all falls down of course." 
"Pity," said Arthur with sympathy. "It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise." 
Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. 
"Come," said Slartibartfast, "you are to meet the mice. Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable 
excitement. It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe." "What were the first two?" 
"Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly. He opened the door and stood waiting for 
Arthur to follow. 
Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he 
had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning. 
"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he muttered to himself. 
"I beg your pardon?" said the old man mildly. 
"Oh nothing," said Arthur, "only joking." 
Chapter 31 It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother. The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy , now positively identified as the source of the offending remark. For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across , which happened to be the Earth , where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog. Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. "It's just life," they say. A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards. Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered. + "Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. "Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good." The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. They were stuffing their faces. "What happened to you?" demanded Arthur. "Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us. Here," he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, "have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet. It's delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing." "Hosts?" said Arthur. "What hosts? I don't see any ..." A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch, Earth creature." 
Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped. 
"Ugh!" he said. "There are mice on the table!" 
There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur. 
He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table. He heard 
the silence and glanced around at everyone. 
"Oh!" he said, with sudden realization. "Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite prepared for ..." 
"Let me introduce you," said Trillian. "Arthur this is Benji mouse." 
"Hi," said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the 
inside of the whisky-glass like affair, and it moved forward slightly. 
"And this is Frankie mouse." 
The other mouse said, "Pleased to meet you," and did likewise. 
Arthur gaped. 
"But aren't they ..." 
"Yes," said Trillian, "they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth." 
She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug. 
"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?" she said. 
Slartibartfast coughed politely. 
"Er, excuse me," he said. 
"Yes, thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji mouse sharply, "you may go." 
"What? Oh ... er, very well," said the old man, slightly taken aback, "I'll just go and get on with some of my 
fjords then." 
"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It looks very much as if we won't be 
needing the new Earth any longer." He swivelled his pink little eyes. "Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed." "What?" cried Slartibartfast, aghast. "You can't mean that! I've got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!" 
"Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them," said Frankie, acidly. 
"Skiing holiday!" cried the old man. "Those glaciers are works of art! Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!" "Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all." 
"Yes sir," said the old man coldly, "thank you very much. Well, goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, 
"hope the lifestyle comes together." 
With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room. 
Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say. 
"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business." 
Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together. 
"To business!" they said. 
"I beg your pardon?" said Benji. 
Ford looked round. 
"Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast," he said. 
The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports. Finally they composed themselves, and 
Benji moved forward to address Arthur. + "Now, Earth creature," he said, "the situation we have in effect is this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question." "Why?" said Arthur, sharply. "No , we already thought of that one," said Frankie interrupting, "but it doesn't fit the answer. Why?  
Forty-Two ... you see, it doesn't work." 
"No," said Arthur, "I mean why have you been doing it?" 
"Oh, I see," said Frankie. "Well, eventually just habit I think, to be brutally honest. And this is more or less 
the point , we're sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends." "Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension," put in Benji. 
"Since when," continued his murine colleague, "we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to 
do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we're very 
much inclined to take it." 
"I would, wouldn't you Ford?" said Zaphod promptingly. 
"Oh yes," said Ford, "jump at it, like a shot." 
Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. "But we've got to have a product you see," said Frankie, "I mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other." Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. "You see," he said, "if they're just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two, then the show's probably quite short. No follow-up, you see." "We have to have something that sounds good," said Benji. "Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a 
couple of mice?" 
The mice bristled. 
"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but 
there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise," said Frankie. "But ..." started Arthur, hopelessly. "Hey, will you get this, Earthman," interrupted Zaphod. "You are a last generation product of that 
computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?" 
"Er ..." 
"So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer programme," said 
Ford, rather lucidly he thought. 
"Right?" said Zaphod. 
"Well," said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything. He had 
always seen this as one of his problems. 
"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, "there's a good chance 
that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain , so we want to buy it off you." 
"What, the question?" said Arthur. 
"Yes," said Ford and Trillian. 
"For lots of money," said Zaphod. + "No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy." 
"What!" 
"I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically," protested Ford. 
"Oh yes," said Frankie, "but we'd have to get it out first. It's got to be prepared." "Treated," said Benji. 
"Diced." 
"Thank you," shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror. 
"It could always be replaced," said Benji reasonably, "if you think it's important." 
"Yes, an electronic brain," said Frankie, "a simple one would suffice." 
"A simple one!" wailed Arthur. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to program it to say What? and I don't 
understand and Where's the tea? , who'd know the difference?" 
"What?" cried Arthur, backing away still further. 
"See what I mean?" said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something that Trillian did at that 
moment. 
"I'd notice the difference," said Arthur. 
"No you wouldn't," said Frankie mouse, "you'd be programmed not to." 
Ford made for the door. 
"Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads," he said. "I don't think we've got a deal." 
"I rather think we have to have a deal," said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing fro their piping 
little voices in an instant. With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything. Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was dead weight -he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him. She screamed at him, but he just gaped. 
With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of 
rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty. They charged. So , Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were. All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din. Chapter 32 "Emergency! Emergency!" blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea. "Hostile ship has landed on planet. 
Armed intruders in section 8A. Defence stations, defence stations!" 
The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on 
the floor. 
"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain." He scuttled 
round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. 
"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, "is to try and 
fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible." 
"Difficult," said Frankie. He thought. "How about What's yellow and dangerous?" 
Benji considered this for a moment. 
"No, no good," he said. "Doesn't fit the answer." 
They sank into silence for a few seconds. 
"Alright," said Benji. "What do you get if you multiply six by seven?" 
"No, no, too literal, too factual," said Frankie, "wouldn't sustain the punters' interest." 
Again they thought. 
Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?" 
"Ah," said Benji. "Aha, now that does sound promising!" He rolled the phrase around a little. "Yes," he 
said, "that's excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!" They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards. Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out. They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly. 
"Which way do you reckon Zaphod?" said Ford. 
"At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank 
and the wall. As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt that 
cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall. 
A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We've got you covered." 
"Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to try a guess at all, Ford?" 
"OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks. 
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-
Zap gun. 
"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. 
"Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units. 
The others swerved in behind him. 
"There are two of them," said Trillian. "We're cornered." 
They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall. 
They held their breath and waited. 
Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. 
"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, "I thought they said they didn't want to 
do that." 
"Yeah, I thought they said that," agreed Ford. 
Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. 
"Hey," he said, "I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us!" and ducked again. 
They waited. 
After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!" 
"What did he say?" whispered Ford in astonishment. 
"He said it isn't easy being a cop." 
"Well surely that's his problem isn't it?" 
"I'd have thought so." 
Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, 
so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!" 
Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. 
"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-
pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent 
caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially! I don't go around gratuitously shooting 
people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my 
girlfriend!" 
"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I better 
warn you, I'm in a meeeean mood!" 
Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these guys?" he said. 
"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were shooting." 
"So are you going to come quietly," shouted one of the cops again, "or are you going to let us blast you 
out?" 
"Which would you prefer?" shouted Ford. 
A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into 
the computer bank in front of them. 
The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity. 
When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad the echoes died away. 
"You still there?" called one of the cops. 
"Yes," they called back. 
"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. 
"We could tell," shouted Ford. 
"Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!" 
"Why?" shouted Back Zaphod. 
"Because," shouted the cop, "it's going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane! Now 
either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course 
because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or 
two others we noticed on our way out here!" "But that's crazy!" cried Trillian. "You wouldn't do that!" "Oh yes we would," shouted the cop, "wouldn't we?" he asked the other one. "Oh yes, we'd have to, no question," the other one called back. "But why?" demanded Trillian. "Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all 
about sensitivity and everything!" 
"I just don't believe these guys," muttered Ford, shaking his head. 
One cop shouted to the other, "Shall we shoot them again for a bit?" "Yeah, why not?" They let fly another electric barrage. The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end. Chapter 33 But the end never came, at least not then. Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds. The four stared at each other. "What happened?" said Arthur. "They stopped," said Zaphod with a shrug. "Why?" "Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?" "No." They waited. "Hello?" called out Ford. No answer. "That's odd." "Perhaps it's a trap." "They haven't the wit." "What were those thuds?" "Dunno." They waited for a few more seconds. "Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look." He glanced round at the others. "Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" They all shook their heads. 
"Oh well," he said, and stood up. 
For a moment, nothing happened. 
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered through the thick smoke that was 
billowing out of the burning computer. 
Cautiously he stepped out into the open. 
Still nothing happened. 
Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited figure of one of the cops. He 
was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man. No 
one else was anywhere to be seen. 
This struck Ford as being extremely odd. 
Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, 
and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that still 
dangled from its limp fingers. 
He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. 
The cop was quite clearly dead. 
A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa , he was a methane-breathing life form, 
dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. 
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up. 
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These miniature suit computers usually had the full 
back-up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the sub-etha. Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously. He called the others over to look. They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity. "Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away. The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast. It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls. It said, This is probably the best button to press. Chapter 34 The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land. R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own. Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. Beside it stood another one. It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected. It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead. Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious , a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his experience the Universe simply didn't work like that. The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity. Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust. "Marvin!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?" "Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a muffled drone. "But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. "Very depressed." "What's up?" 
"I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there." 
"Why," said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, "are you lying face down in the dust?" 
"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know 
you hate me." 
"No I don't." 
"Yes you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and 
they begin to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away." 
He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction. 
"That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft. 
"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to it? Do you know?" 
"It hated me because I talked to it." 
"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked to it?" 
"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I 
talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. 
"And what happened?" pressed Ford. 
"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold. 
Chapter 35 That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something about it. + He came across this entry. It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. "For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?" He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life. "Hey Earthman? You hungry kid?" said Zaphod's voice. "Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose," said Arthur. "OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the Emperor , an elected Governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place. The President in particular is very much a figurehead , he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had , he has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer. They couldn't be more wrong. Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as "boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven". Douglas Adams 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe 
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
There is another theory which states that this has already happened. 

Chapter 1 
The story so far: 
In the beginning the Universe was created. 
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. 
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. 
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. 
However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. 
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty-two , and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. 
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet , especially by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. 
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. 
Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way , so they claimed , for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. 
Or so it would seem. 
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived. 
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers. 
Tricia McMillian , or Trillian , had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. 
Two survivors. 
They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted , to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them. 

Chapter 2 
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. 
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born , or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. 
In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once. They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry. 
One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished , particularly this Vogon, and particularly , for various reasons , this job. 
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth. 
He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned. 
It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. 
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. 
He had other fish to fry. 
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words "integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away. 
In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over. 
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. 
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the line." 
Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who 

knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as "my private brain care specialist" there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. 
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?" 
The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant. + "Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour 
for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence." 
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say." 
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are 
clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of the mission?" 

"We have located the ship." 
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?" 
"The Earthman is there." 
"Excellent! And ...?" 
"A female from the same planet. They are the last." 
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?" 
"The man Prefect." 
"Yes?" 

"And Zaphod Beeblebrox." 
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered. 
"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most regrettable." 
"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to 

try it out. 
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not make personal friends." 
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." 
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack." 
He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly. 
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most profitable clients. He had personality 

problems beyond the dreams of analysts." 
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. 
"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?" 
"Yes." 
"Good. Destroy the ship immediately." 
"What about Beeblebrox?" 
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?" 
He vanished from the screen. 
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. 
"Attack," he said. 
At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had 

said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had 

had a blazing row with the ship's computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out 

the Improbability factors with a pencil. 
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen. 
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it. He didn't know exactly why he had 
stolen it, except that he liked it. 
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be. 

He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time. 
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. 
"Starpox!" he shouted. 
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stair-well which led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door and explained what was on his mind. 
"Vogons," he said. 
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. 
It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea. 
He attempted to reason with the thing. 
"Tea," he said. 
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid. 
He threw it away. 
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with another one. 
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years. 
The motto stands , or rather stood , in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives , now deceased. 
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration. 
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. 
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep 
giving me the same undrinkable stuff?" 
"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine. "Share and Enjoy." 

"It tastes filthy!" 
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the machine, "why not share it with your 
friends?" 

"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try to comprehend what I'm telling you? That 

drink ..." 
"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for 
nutrition and pleasure." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?" 

"Share and Enjoy." 

"Oh shut up." 

"Will that be all?" 

Arthur decided to give up. 

"Yes," he said. 

Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up. 

"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple ... all I want ... is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for 

me. Keep quiet and listen." 
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it 
about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons 

on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it 
(briefly) about the history of the East India Company. 
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished. 
"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want." 
"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?" 
"Er, yes. With milk." 
"Squirted out of a cow?" 
"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ..." 

"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine tersely. All the cheerful burbling had 
dropped out of its voice and it now meant business. 
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur. 
"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him. 
It summoned up the ship's computer. 

"Hi there!" said the ship's computer. 
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The computer boggled, linked logic circuits 
with the Nutri-Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence. 

Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened. 
He thumped it, but still nothing happened. 
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. 
In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the 

Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship. 


Chapter 3 
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen. 
He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them. 
"Hello?" he said. 
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces that contained the instruments 

that controlled the conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. 
"Something up?" said Arthur. 
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the Infinite 
Improbability Drive, "the monkey spoke!" 
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut out. 
"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, "a talking monkey!" 
"If you're upset about something ..." said Arthur. 
"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!" 

Arthur gibbered. 
"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!" 
"Can't. Computer's jammed." 
"Jammed?" 
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere in the ship." 
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back 

against the wall. 
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. 
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had been demolished, he had used to play 

football. He had not been at all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in 

important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of 

his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass 

and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment. 
A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his 
brow. 
He started to speak, and stopped. 
He started to speak again and stopped again. 
Finally he managed to speak. 

"Er," he said. He cleared his throat. 
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him. He glanced at 
the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen. 

"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was occupying it? I just ask out of interest ..." 

Their eyes were riveted on him. 

"And, er ... well that's it really, just asking." 

Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. 

"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed. 

"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to 

..." 
"Yes?" 
"Make me some tea." 

"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. 
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing. The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force-shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn't 
be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he said a short while later. "Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then 
gave Arthur an unfriendly look. 
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty seconds." 
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod. 
"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five seconds." 
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had expected a chase, he had expected 

an exciting grapple with tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart of Gold's Infinite Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it. 
A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still 
it just sat there and took it. 
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery 
was to be found. 

He didn't know about the tea of course. 

Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold were spending the last three minutes 
and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend. 
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was 

never quite clear on. 
Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon. 
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives 

led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and, what's more, be able to do 

something about helping to postpone this reunion. 
Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark 
area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. 

"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford. "Yeah." 
"Does it have to be now?" 
The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was rising. The light was getting dimmer , all the energy the computer didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force-field. 
"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to help us." 
"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care." 
"Suggest something else we can do." 
"Er, well ..." 
"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian, Monkeyman, move." 
They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held 

hands. With his third hand Zaphod turned off the lights. 
Darkness gripped the ship. 
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued to rip at the force-field. 
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name." 
"What is it?" asked Arthur. 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth." 
"What?" 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!" 
"The Fourth?" 
"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather 

Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third ..." 
"What?" 
"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!" 
"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect. 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?" 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say? 

The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid 
Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own. Round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. 
They concentrated. 
Still they concentrated. 
And still they concentrated. 
The seconds ticked by. 
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frustration and finally of 

embarrassment. 

At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch. "Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on," said a voice. "No, not too bright please, my 
eyes aren't what they once were." 
Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place. "Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at 
the far end of the bridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes weren't what they once were, they must once have been diamond cutters. 
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of familial respect. 
"Oh ... er, hi Great Granddad ..." he breathed. 
The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered through the dim light. He thrust out a bony 
finger at his great grandson. 

"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth." 
"The First." 
"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It always seemed to him to screech like 

fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul. 
He shifted awkwardly in his seat. 
"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look, I'm really sorry about the flowers, I meant to send them along, but you 

know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and ..." 
"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Well ..." 
"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the same." 
"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper. 
Zaphod fidgeted nervously. 
"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to my great grandmother as well, just as soon 

as we get out of this ..." 
"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to himself. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what, I'll go and see her. But first we've just got to ..." 
"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 
"Ah. Oh." 
"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod ..." 
"Yeah well ..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation, and Ford's heavy 

breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had 

reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom. 

"Er, Great Grandfather ..." 

"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency ..." 

"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see ..." 

"Not to say contempt!" 

"Could you sort of listen for a moment ..." 

"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?" 
"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an exaggeration, but it was his only 
opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across. 

"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure with a shrug. 

"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod feverishly. 

The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had brought in and looked at it with interest. 

"Er ... Great Granddad ..." 

"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has 
developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit?" 
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. 
"Er, no ... look," he said. 
"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering, 
stick-like see-through finger at Zaphod. 

"Your fault!" he screeched. 

"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands. 

"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because ..." 

"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat. 

"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise ..." 

"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He 
stood amazed. 
"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your ..." the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, 
"with your disreputable friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have done, would 

have been quite appropriate from you, but no. Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical , till you suddenly 
find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-minded!" 
He shook his head , carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one, which was already 

becoming restive. 
"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll have to think about this one." 
"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously. 
"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said. 
"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got left to live." 
"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't apply to me, of course," he said and 

moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at. 

Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and 
have done with it. 
"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still alive, and we are about to lose our lives." 
"Good job too." 
"What?" 

"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've made of it the phrase 'pig's ear' comes 
irresistibly to my mind." 
"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!" 
"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?" 
"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!" 
"Conceited little megapuppy." 
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment. 

"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather." 
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This 
had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a thing. 

"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here. 'Life is wasted on the living."' 
"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my 
heads." 
"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect. 
"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 
"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Oh yes." 
"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in fact help us?" 
"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod. 
Ford nodded despondently. 
"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?" 
"Could we go into this later?" 

"Have you forgotten!" insisted the ghost. 
"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain when you get the job you know. If they'd 
found my head full of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat 
pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats." 

"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!" 

He paused for a moment. 
"Good," he said and the noise stopped. 
"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. He looked again at his watch and tapped it. He looked up. 
"Hey, the noise has stopped," he said. 
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes. 
"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say." 
"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod leaping out of his chair, "A , thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B , no thanks for the homily, right? I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know. And I resent that, right? 
"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain , my own brain , and locked off the bits that knew and cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I wouldn't be able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able to steal this ship, which must be the important thing. 
"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. That's what he wanted, that's what he got. 
"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well, I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my choice. I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my own." 
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded looks he was attracting. 
"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living!" 
"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the ghost. 
"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different isn't it?" 
He grinned at Trillian, weakly. 
"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use for it." 
"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is. Try me." 
"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must find , the man who controls this Galaxy, and , we suspect , others. Possibly the entire Universe." 
"Why?" 

"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you lad, does it look to you as if it's in very 
good hands?" 
"It's alright." 
The old ghost glowered at him. 
"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. 

You will do it. Don't think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field controls you, you are in 
its grip. What's this?" 
He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him. 
"What's it doing?" 

"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea." "Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now Zaphod, "he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as I did. The principal reason I am helping you now is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. Understood?" 
"Yeah, thanks a bundle." 
"Oh, and Zaphod?" 
"Er, yeah?" 
"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner ..." 
"Yeah?" 
"Please don't hesitate to get lost." 
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghost's hands to the 

computer, the ghost vanished, the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space. 

Chapter 4 
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away, and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. 
Good, he thought. 
The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. 
The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, he thought. 
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the Meaning of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, he thought. 
"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as the smoke began to clear. 
He paused, then looked about. 
"Where's Zaphod?" he said. 
Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was. 
"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?" 
A moment later he said: 
"Where's Marvin?" 
The robot's corner was empty. 
The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every 

instrument was dead, every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It said: 
"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music." 
They turned off the light music. 
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm. Everywhere was dead and 

silent. Nowhere was there any trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. 
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the Nutri-Matic machine was located. 
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a small tray, on which sat three bone china 

cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait". 

Chapter 5 
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe. 
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words "When you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the suicide rate quadrupled overnight. 
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. 
It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. 
No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal anomaly". 
There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere. 
If you approach Light City by air , and there is no other way of approaching it, no roads, no port facilities , if you don't fly they don't want to see you in Light City , you will see why it has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white, palm-lined boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the villas, the hazy airpads, the beach bars and so on. 
Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected by a bridge half-way up their length. 
The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company. 
The book is a guide book, a travel book. 
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor , more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and Fifty, better selling than The Big Bang Theory , A Personal View by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six) and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out. 
(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly it has the words Don't Panic printed in large friendly letters on its cover.) 
It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day , The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words continuously. 
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon , it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind it lie the night clubs. 
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime , call it what you will , you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-Betans chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were. 
You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of the Hitch Hiker's Guide building itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan dollars. 
"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly. 
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused. 
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold. 
"Absolute sell out," said the voice again. 
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. 
"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place like this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!" 
Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And why? 
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you. 
Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a little bit. 
The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice. 
"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've even heard that they've created a whole electronically synthesized Universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place." 
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing, but why? 
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts of his mind. 
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. 
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired, confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the thought meant. 

Chapter 6 
"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large pink-winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they ever did was complain. It shivered its wings. 
"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to Mr Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now. He's on an intergalactic cruise." 
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call. 
"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed down the phone. 
"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book. 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's always reality that's got it wrong. 
This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate." 
This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists") they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect receptionist. 
"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop." 
"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be addressed in this manner. 
"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now." 
"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could be a little cool about it ..." 
"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat 

inside me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before you 

blow it?" 
"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its 
disposal, "I'm afraid that isn't possible right now as Mr Zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise." 

Hell, thought Zaphod. 

"When he's going to be back?" he said. 

"Back sir? He's in his office." 

Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind. He didn't succeed. 

"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise ... in his office?" He leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. 

"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get stranger things than you free with my 
breakfast cereal." 
"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod 
Beeblebrox or something?" 
"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp. 
The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. 
"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want one." 
"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?" 
"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six packs?" 
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. 
"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio report. It said that you were dead ..." 
"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?" 
"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but ..." 
"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to him." 
"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical People Transporters are in the far corner sir. 
But sir ..." 
Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back. 
"Yeah?" he said. 
"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I told myself I had to." 
"Come again sir?" 
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally. 
"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he said, "as a result of an argument with the ghost 
of my great grandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former self, the one that operated on my brain, 
popped into my head and said 'Go see Zarniwoop'. I have never heard of the cat. That is all I know. That 
and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules the Universe." 

He winked. 

"Mr Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so weird you should be in movies." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, "and you, baby, should be in real life." 

The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and then reached out a tentacle to answer a 

ringing phone. 
A metal hand restrained it. 
"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that would have made an insect of a more 

sentimental disposition collapse in tears. 
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots. 
"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" 
"I doubt it," said Marvin. 
"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me ..." Six of the phones were now ringing. A million things awaited 

the insect's attention. 
"No one can help me," intoned Marvin. 
"Yes, sir, well ..." 
"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand fell limply by Marvin's side. His head hung 

forward very slightly. 

"Is that so," said the insect tartly. 
"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?" 
"I'm sorry, sir, if ..." 
"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?" 
"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be able to drag itself out of this 

conversation. 
"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it. 
"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal ..." 
"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?" 
The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again. 
"Is it worth it?" it asked. 
"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately. 
"What ... do ... you ... want?" 
"I'm looking for someone." 
"Who?" hissed the insect. 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there." 
The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. 
"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed. 
"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin. 
"What!" 
"Pathetic isn't it?" 
With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught up with Zaphod approaching the 

elevators. Zaphod span round in astonishment. 
"Hey ... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?" 
Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. 
"I don't know," he said. 
"But ..." 

"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here 
feeling utterly miserable. An Improbability Field I expect." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company." 
"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath. 
"So, how are you?" he said aloud. 
"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which personally I don't." 

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened. "Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices. If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do besides talk?" 
"I go up," said the elevator, "or down." 
"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up." 
"Or down," the elevator reminded him. 
"Yeah, OK, up please." 
There was a moment of silence. 
"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully. 
"Oh yeah?" 
"Super." 
"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?" 
"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the 

possibilities that down might offer you?" Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food. 
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be someone else. Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator. 
"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily. 
"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's the basement, the microfiles, the heating 
system ... er ..." 
It paused. 
"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are alternatives." 
"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist elevator?" he beat his fists against the 

wall. 
"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat. 
"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's afraid." 
"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's afraid of heights?" 
"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future ..." 
"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing want, a pension scheme?" 
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them. From the walls around them 

came the sound of suddenly active machinery. 

"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror, "it's part of our 
programming." 
Zaphod looked out of the elevator , an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area, pointing 

and shouting. 
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast. 
He ducked back in. 
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've got to get to Zarniwoop." 
"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully. 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better have a very good reason for me wanting to 

see him." 
Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and "maximum-capacity.
eight-persons" jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People 
Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. 
This is because they operate on the curios principle of "defocused temporal perception". In other words 

they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the 

right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, 

relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators. 
Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with 
the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going 
sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process and 
finally took to squatting in basements sulking. 

An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy 
money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators. 
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly. 

"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember, I'm only doing this because I like your robot." 
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as 
fast as its mechanism would take it. 

Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where 

Zarniwoop might be found. All the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked. 
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other. 
Through a large window the brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced small 
specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. 

"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty. 
They both stood and looked in both directions. 
"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin. 
"More that you can possibly imagine." 
"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said. 
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet , and another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of 

dust danced more vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. 
Zaphod looked at the floor. 
"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while 

you work, or ..." 
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 

Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz. Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to 
the window. 
"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!" 

Another roar cracked through the building. 
"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?" asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to stagger back to the elevator , a pointless manoeuvre he realized, but the only one he could think of. 
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this one, he caught sight of a figure as it 
lunged into view, a man. The man saw him. 
"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. 
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building. 
"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?" 
"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. 

"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just generally well disposed of people?" 
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket. He was 
short, stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice round the Galaxy and 
back with him in them. 

"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your building's being bombed?" 
The man indicated his awareness. 
It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge 

sluglike, gunmetal-green spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. 

"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed the man, "they've sent a squadron of 
Frogstar Fighters." 
"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!" 
"You get the picture?" 
"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard someone talk about them when he was 

President, but he never paid much attention to official matters. 

The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him. With a searing whine a small black 
spider-like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor. 
"What was that?" hissed Zaphod. 
"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man. 
"Hey yeah?" 
"Get down!" 

From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like object. It zapped past them. 
"And that was ...?" 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you." 
"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air. 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you." 
"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?" 
From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic black shape was moving over it from the 

opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank. 
"Holy photon, what's that?" 
"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you." 
"Should we leave?" 
"I think we should." 
"Marvin!" called Zaphod. 
"What do you want?" 
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them. 
"You see that robot coming towards us?" 
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge. He looked down 

at his own small metal body. He looked back up at the tank. 
"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said. 
"Yeah." 
"Whilst you save your skins." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!" 
"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand." 
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off down the corridor. 
A point occurred to him about this. 
"Where are we going?" he said. 
"Zarniwoop's office." 

"Is this any time to keep an appointment?" 
"Come on." 

Chapter 7 
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing. 
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank 
examined him with a probe. The probe withdrew. 
Marvin stood there. 
"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank. 
"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop you." 
The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. 
"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!" 
"No, really I have," said Marvin simply. 
"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief. 

"Guess," said Marvin. 
The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized electronic relays deep in its micro-brain 
flipped backwards and forwards in consternation. 

"Guess?" said the tank. 
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second and along a third. The 

building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building up, 
why was it taking so long? 
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it. With 

a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside. 
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-lying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and 

for what? A single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The desk, apart 
from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty. 
"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole 

exercise was beginning to slip. 
"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man. 

Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices. 
"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and this is my towel." 
"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod. 
"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel. Not knowing what to 

do with it, he shook it by the corner. 
Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green spaceships growled past. 
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll never guess." 
"Errmmm ..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed thought, "laser beams?" 
Marvin shook his head solemnly. 
"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded. 
"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin. 
"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er ... how about an electron ram?" 
This was new to Marvin. 
"What's that?" he said. 
"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm. 
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall 

roared and collapsed as a heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. 
"No," said Marvin, "not one of those." 
"Good though, isn't it?" 
"Very good," agreed Marvin. 
"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment's consideration, "you must have one of 

those new Xanthic Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!" 
"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin. 
"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe. 
"No," said Marvin. 
"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be ..." 

"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots." 
"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it ..." it tailed off into thought again. 
"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty 
battle machine, whilst they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?" 

"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty damn devastating I should expect." 

"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall I@" 

"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself. 

"Nothing," said Marvin. 

There was a dangerous pause. 

"Nothing?" roared the battle machine. 

"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic sausage." 

The machine heaved about with fury. 

"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing, eh? Just don't think, do they?" 

"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side." 

"Makes you spit, doesn't it?" 

"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling. 

"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll smash that wall down!" 

The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine. 

"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly. 

"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered. 

"Yes," said Marvin. 

"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the tank. 

It took out the ceiling of the bridge. 

"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin. 

"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take out this floor too, no trouble!" 

It took out the floor, too. 
"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. 
"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged away. 

Chapter 8 
"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do these guys out here want?" 
"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the Frogstar -the most totally evil world in 
the Galaxy." 
"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first." 
"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the window." 
Zaphod looked, and gaped. 
"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the ground?" 
"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne." 
Clouds streaked past the office window. 
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted 

tower of the building. A network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip. 
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity. 
"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a building, they take it away." 
"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta, "it's what you're going to do." 
"Well don't I get a say in that?" 
"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast and bumpy journey." 
"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't know what's hit me." 
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched 

himself off. 

On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought. He 
caught Trillian's eyes as she looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the rack. 
Finally he saw it. 
He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack. 
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. 

"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot I'm afraid." 
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th time. 
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. 
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead 

instruments. 
Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought. 
Why did it rock and sway? 
Why could he not find out where they were? 
Where, basically, were they? 
The left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at 

a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe. 
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily. 
Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance. 
"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded Zaphod. 
"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the Universe." 
"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod. 
"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about whether they got food?" 
"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar." 
Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force beams, and vague green 

streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this speed, space itself 
was invisible, and indeed unreal. 
"Here, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel. 
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring. 
"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta. 

"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod. 
"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink 
flowers contain wheatgerm extracts." 

Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement. 

"What are the brown stains?" he asked. 
"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm." 
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully. 
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again. 
"Ugh," he stated. 
"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually need to suck the other end a bit too." 
"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?" 
"Anti-depressants," said Roosta. 
"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing it back. 
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet 

up. 

"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have you any idea what's going to happen to 
you on the Frogstar?" 
"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully. 
"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total Perspective Vortex!" 
Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he 

assumed that the Total Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was. 
"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can undergo." 
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod. 
"So," he said, "no food, huh?" 
"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total 

Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest 
of your life!" 
"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod sharply. 
"This is worse." 
"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed. 
"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added a moment later. 
"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever. They know what you're after." 

"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?" 
"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet the man who rules the Universe." 
"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added: 
"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to 

meet a cook." 
Roosta sighed heavily. 
"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all this got to so with you?" 
"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with 

your great grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox." 
"Me?" 
"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how much." 
"But ..." 
"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you." 
"What job, man, what are you talking about?" 
"I will do it before I leave you." 
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence. 
Zaphod was terribly glad. 


Chapter 9 
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome. 
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted. 
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here. 
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. 
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend. 
About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings. 
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting for something. 
The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. 
The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B. 
As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men. 
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said: 
"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do." 
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. 
"Yeah?" he said. 
"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window." 
"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it. 
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. 
Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex. 
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with. 
He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside. 
Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping. 
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. 
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down 
made his heads spin. 
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask 
merely for information," did little to improve his state of mind. 

About half-way down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood. 
A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. 
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen. 
In fact, it looked almost human. 
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion. 
"Go away," said Zaphod. 
"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again. 
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. 
"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He was quite prepared to believe the 

alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating. 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 
"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear. 
Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He 

grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, breathing heavily. 
The voice had no visible source whatever , there was no one there. Nevertheless, it spoke again. 
"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight." 
Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In other circumstances it would even be 

described as soothing. There is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building. 
"Hey, er ..." he stammered. 
"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly. 
"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?" 
"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective 

Vortex." 
"Why can't I see ..." 
"You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated," the voice lifted, "if you move about two 

yards to your left. Why don't you try it?" 

Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the 
building. Gratefully he shifted himself across to them. 
"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his ear, and as it spoke it faded. 
"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you ..." 
"It'll only take a couple of minutes ..." said the voice very faintly. 
"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him, "Did a ... did a voice just ..." 
"Yes," Marvin replied tersely. 
Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. They were completely black, and by 

now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find 

his way down the building more comfortably if he didn't actually have to look at what he was doing. 
Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and, once more 
removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground. 

Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble, from which position he 

seemed too disinclined to move. 
"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear, "excuse me leaving you like that, it's just 
that I have a terrible head for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did have a terrible head for heights." 

Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings. 
"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?" 
"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to 

do, people to see." After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with 
bodies." 
Zaphod wasn't sure about this. 

"I thought I did," he said. 
"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice, "the way it's been living recently it must be on its last elbows." 
"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?" 
The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. He didn't know if it was gone or was 
still there or what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again. 

"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?" 

"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, "this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can 
just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery, you know?" 
"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr. 
"Er, no." 
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was 

obscuring his view. 
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. 
"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then." 
"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must come. Follow me." 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?" 
"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming." 
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of 

focus. It was only by listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else was there to do? 

Chapter 10 
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore. 
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do. 
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches. 
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous 
crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed 
whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. 

Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the Galaxy which is not in some way guilty 

of the same thing, which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is. 
For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire 
unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a 
microscopic dot, which says "You are here." 

The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. The wind whipped wildly over it. 

Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. 
This was the Total Perspective Vortex. 
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having 

his soul burnt from his body. It screamed above the wind and died away. 
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium. 
"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. 
"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the Vortex. It is always played to the next 

victim. A sort of prelude." 

"Hey, it really sounds bad ..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we maybe slope off to a party or something 
for a while, think it over?" 
"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of 

parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho." 

"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen 
to him. 
"Well, it's ... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly. 
"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod. 
There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke again. 
"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark in rather poor taste." 
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. 
"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know." 
The voice fluttered unhappily. 
"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control, "the 

truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in divorce." 

The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say. He mumbled uncertainly. 
"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It won't even see me ..." 
He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. 
"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename." 
"Oh ..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?" 
"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really doesn't it?" 
"Errr ..." said Zaphod sympathetically. 
"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job, Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex , they don't really count I'm afraid." 
"Ah ..." 
"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?" 
"Er ..." 
"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet , people, cities shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing. It's a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result -collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds , you've seen one of them , who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the Vortex." 
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain. 
"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?" 
"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in the evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep." 
At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered. 
"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed. 
"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite 

distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small." 
"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his 
ego. 

Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel 

dome in the middle of the plain. 

As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small darkened chamber within. 

"Enter," said Gargravarr. 

Zaphod started with fear. 

"Hey, what, now?" he said. 

"Now." 
Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It was steel-lined and there was hardly 
space in it for more than one man. 

"It ... er ... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me," said Zaphod. 

"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter." 

With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of Gargravarr being in the elevator with 

him, though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking. 
The elevator began its descent. 
"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this," muttered Zaphod. 
"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly. 
"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate." 
"I don't. The Vortex does." 
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, 

functional, steel-lined chamber. 
At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a man to stand in. 
It was that simple. 
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire. 
"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise. 

"That is it." 
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod. 
"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod. 
"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do it now." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod. 
He opened the door of the box and stepped in. 
Inside the box he waited. 
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him. 


Chapter 11 
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. 
To explain , since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation , every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. 
The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife. 
Trin Tragula , for that was his name , was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. 
And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake. 
"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as often as thirty-eight times in a single day. 
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex , just to show her. 
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it. 
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. 
The door of the Vortex swung open. 
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. 
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. 
Instead, he stepped out. 
"Hi!" he said. 
"Beeblebrox ..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement. 
"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod. 
"You ... you ... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr. 
"You saw me, kid." 
"And it was working?" 
"Sure was." 
"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?" 
"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?" 
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been with him it would have sat down 

heavily with its mouth hanging open. 
"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?" 
"Oh, yeah, yeah." 
"But ... what did you experience?" 
Zaphod shrugged smugly. 
"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm 

Zaphod Beeblebrox!" 
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped, startled. 
He breathed heavily. 
"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?" 
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded. 
"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I wouldn't have time to eat it." 
He ate it. 


Chapter 12 
A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city. 
The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous. 
The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him , everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine is another. 
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter. 
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide. 
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up. 
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism. 
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. 
He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. 
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with ... well with anything. 
He approached the building. Along one side of it , the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area , were three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran. 
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor. 
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris. 
The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. 
They were all spacecraft, all derelict. 
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself. 
Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old feedline. 
He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship. 
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming slightly. 
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his hands. 
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline 

to the point where it connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight humming 

vibration was more distinct. 
His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ship's side. He could 
only hear a faint, indeterminate noise. 

He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non-biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. 
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. 
The voice said: 
"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight. We 

are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again." 
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. 
He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure 

board still hanging, but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with grime, but 
some of the figures were still discernible. 
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calculations. His eyes widened. 
"Nine hundred years ..." he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was. 
Two minutes later he was on board. 
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool and fresh -the air conditioning was still 

working. 
The lights were still on. 
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it. 
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. 

"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess and, turning her back on him, she walked on 

down the corridor in front of him. 
When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She opened the door at the end of the corridor 
and walked through. 

He followed her through the door. 
They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart stopped still again for a moment. 
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. 
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards. 
All of them were quite clearly alive , but sleeping. 
Zaphod had the creeping horrors. 
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was half-way down the aisle, the 

stewardess had reached the other end. She turned and spoke. 
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank you for bearing with us during this 

slight delay. We will be taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will serve 
you coffee and biscuits." 
There was a slight hum. 
At that moment, all the passengers awoke. 
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support systems that held them tightly in their 

seats. They screamed and bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter. 

They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee 
and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them. 
Then one of them rose from his seat. 
He turned and looked at Zaphod. 
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off. He turned and ran from the 

bedlam. 
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. 
The man pursued him. 
He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on 

the flight deck, slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the door breathing hard. 
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door. 

From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. 
"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to your seat, and wait for the ship to take 
off. Coffee and biscuits are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your seat." 
Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand continued to knock on the door. 
"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck." 
"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod. 
"Please return to your seat." 
"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again. 
"Please return to your seat." 
"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?" 
"Please return to your seat." 
You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod. 
"Yes," said the voice from the flight console. 

"You're in charge of this ship?" 
"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended 
animation, for their comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served every year, after 
which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience. 
Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay." 

Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased. He approached the flight 

console. 
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship? It's a wasteland, a desert. Civilization's 
been and gone, man. There are no lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!" 

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that other civilizations will arise. There will 
one day be lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat." 

"But ..." 
But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see the man who had pursued him standing 
there. He carried a large briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no beard and 
no long fingernails. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe you wanted to see me." Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He dropped into a chair. 
"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said. 
"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone. 
He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. 
"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by 

the door rather than the window. Then you would have been in trouble." 
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled. 
"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my electronically synthesized Universe," he 

explained, "if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one works 
from here." 
He patted the briefcase smugly. 
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing. 

"What's the difference?" he muttered. 
"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh , except that I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in 
the real Universe." 

"What's going on?" spat Zaphod. 
"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made Zaphod seethe. 
"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated at which this man could be found , the 

man who rules the Universe, and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability field. To protect my secret , and myself , I retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure. Meanwhile, you and I ..." 
"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?" 
"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well." 
"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence. 
"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the Improbability Drive ship , the only one which 

could reach the ruler's world , and bring it to me here. This you have now done I trust, and I congratulate 

you." He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick. 
"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this Universe was created specifically for you 
to come to. You are therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would never," he said with 
an even more brickable smile, "have survived the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?" 

"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed. 
"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?" 
"No." 

"Where is your jacket?" 
Zaphod looked at him in mystification. 
"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside." 
"Good, we will go and find it." 
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him. 
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and 

biscuits. 
"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said Zarniwoop. 
"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think ..." 
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. A few feet away from them they could 

see Zaphod's jacket lying in the debris. 
"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop, "watch." 
As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split, it ripped. The small metal model of the 

Heart of Gold that Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. 
It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its full size. 
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of ... oh I don't know, but something very large." 
Zaphod swayed. 
"You mean I had it with me all the time?" 
"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. 
He twisted a single switch inside it. 
"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!" 
The scene before them shimmered briefly , and reappeared exactly as before. 
"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same." 
"You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all the time?" 
"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point." 
"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in you can count me out. I've had all I want 

of this. You play your own games." 

"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined in the Improbability field. You cannot escape." 
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time Zaphod hit it. 

Chapter 13 
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold. 
"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's reactivated!" 
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. 
"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking them awake. 
"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be back with you again, I can tell you, and I just 

want to say that ..." 
"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are." 
"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so 

amazingly glad to see me you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am." 
"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of this in. 
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to 

see you Trillian, Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer ...?" 
"Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to ..." 
"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast." 
"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?" 
"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he said again, "we want to go to the nearest 

place to eat!" 
"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocket the bridge. 
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he regarded the four wisps of smoke with 

interest. 


Chapter 14 
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever. 
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them. The cold hard shore tipped and span 
and then stood still. It shone darkly , it was a very highly polished cold hard shore. 
A green blur watched them disapprovingly. 
It coughed. 

"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a reservation?" 
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his brain smart. He looked up woozily at 
the green blur. 

"Reservation?" he said weakly. "Yes, sir," said the green blur. 
"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?" 
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now 

did. 
"Afterlife, sir?" it said. 
Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the 

bath. 
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered. 
"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which way was up. He tested the theory that it 

must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to what he hoped were his feet. 
"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have survived that blast is there?" 
"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but it didn't seem to improve things. He 
slumped down again. 

"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all." 

A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I 
certainly didn't survive," he gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it." 
"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We must have been blown to bits. Arms, 

legs everywhere." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet. 
"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks ..." said the green blur, hovering impatiently beside 

them. 
"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into our component molecules. Hey, Ford," 
he said, identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing of your whole life 
flashing before you?" 

"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a lot of time out of my skulls you know." 

He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of 
vague and wobbling shapeless shapes. 
"So ..." he said. 
"So what?" said Ford. 
"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead ..." 
"Standing," Trillian corrected him. 
"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate ..." 
"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could now, much to his surprise, see clearly. 

That is to say, the thing that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. 
"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this desolate ..." 
"Five star ..." said Trillian. 
"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod. 
"Odd isn't it?" said Ford. 
"Er, yeah." 
"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian. 
They looked about themselves in bemusement. 
"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of apres vie." 
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceiling from which they hung 

would not, in an ideal Universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldn't have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not, however, an ideal Universe, as was further evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in. 
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vl'Hurg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond. 
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. These 
were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl 
up his back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ... 
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place. 
"All in good time, sir," he said. 

Zaphod's eyes flashed. 
"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing some ultra-important thing here you 
know. Something somebody said and we missed it." 

Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen. 

He said, "I said it was a sort of apres ..." 

"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?" 

"I said it was odd." 

"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ..." 

"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened 

dark-suited green waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks ..." 
"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you don't stay alert." 
"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner 

..." 

"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green person, my stomach could take you home 
and cuddle you all night for the mere idea." 
"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his home stretch, "will 

explode later for your pleasure." 
Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling. 
"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?" 
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh. 
"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me." 
"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford. 
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough. 
"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the time journey," he said, "so if I might 

suggest ..." 

"Time journey?" said Zaphod. 
"Time journey?" said Ford. 
"Time journey?" said Trillian. 
"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur. 
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire 

and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter. 
"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir." 
"And we're not dead?" said Arthur. 
The waiter tightened his lips. 
"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would not attempt to serve sir." 
In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both 

his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other. 

"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!" "Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this is Milliways , the Restaurant at the 
End of the Universe." 
"End of what?" said Arthur. 
"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and unnecessarily distinctly. 
"When did that end?" said Arthur. 
"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep breath. He didn't need to do this since his 

body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath. 
"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I will then show you to your table." Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it. 

Chapter 15 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been built on the fragmented remains of ... it will be built on the fragmented ... that is to say it will have been built by this time, and indeed has been .
One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history , the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. 
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother. 
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs. 
The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. 
To resume: 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. 
It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. 
This is, many would say, impossible. 
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat (willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation explode around them. 
This is, many would say, equally impossible. 
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time. (you can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome.) 
This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. 
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time. 
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. 
You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re-onvisiting ... and so on , for further tense-corrections consult Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually causes. 
This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, say the doubters. 
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. 
This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon came up with this slogan: "If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?" 

Chapter 16 
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His heads knocked together and his smiles 
were coming out of synch. He was miserably happy. 
"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech, would you care to tell me what the photon 
happened? Where have you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it cleared up." 

Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink. 

"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man who rules the Universe, but I don't care 
to meet him. I believe the man can't cook." 
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded. 
"True," it said, "have another drink." 
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has been described as the alcoholic 

equivalent of a mugging , expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided, he 
didn't really care too much. 
"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody." 

"You mean everything's under control." 
"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control. That would not be cool and froody. If you 
want to know what happened let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket. OK?" 

Ford shrugged. 

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the 
marble bar top. 
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot 

of money and he agreed to go away again. 
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part of the bar. 
"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it gives me the creeps." 
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself." 
"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive." 

"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?" 
"You call this life?" 
"You're beginning to sound like Marvin." 
"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make this violinist go away?" 
The waiter approached. 
"Your table is ready," he said. 
Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a 

forgotten rock. Each of its arms houses the bars, the kitchens, the forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits, and the Time Turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment. 
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete globe, and it was into this area that 
Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian now passed. At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. 
"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo." 
"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people ... ! The things ... !" 
"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people." 
"The people ..." resumed Arthur, "the ... other people ..." 
"The lights ... !" said Trillian. 
"The tables ..." said Arthur. 
"The clothes ... !" said Trillian. 
The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs. 
"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading his way unsteadily through the throng of 

tables, some made of marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus. 
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a sense of occasion." The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where little expense has been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone making an American Express commercial. 
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. 
"Wowee," said Zaphod. 
"Zappo," said Ford. 
"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told 

it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe. Remind me to be nice 
to it one day." 
He paused. 
"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody." 

"Was?" said Arthur. 
"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been 
done you know. Hi, guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms, "How did you do?" 

"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana. 

"I think so," replied the second iguana. 

"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana. 

"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana. 

"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back into silence. They were waiting for the 
greatest show in the Universe. 
"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, 
missing. He pointed a swaying finger. 
"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See the man at the platinum table with the 

platinum suit on?" 
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy. Finally he saw. 
"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Hey," he said, "did that guy ever make it 

megabig! Wow, bigger than the biggest thing ever. Other than me." 
"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian. 
"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know? You never heard of Disaster Area?" 
"No," said Trillian, who hadn't. 
"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest ..." 
"Richest ..." suggested Zaphod. 

"... rock band in the history of ..." he searched for the word. 
"... history itself," said Zaphod. 
"No," said Trillian. 
"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out." 
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone. 
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. 
"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very, very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on regardless. 
"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right? The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?" 
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not. Ford was not perturbed. $ "And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors, you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them. And you said you didn't care, and we said we did because we hated them so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over. 
"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued, wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system. And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!" 
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. 
"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!" 
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. 
"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into his wine glass. 
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing Hotblack Desiato. 
"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over , into a nearby glass as it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. 
"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm! Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!" 
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. 
"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs." 
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. 
"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to the point he had not yet even moved. 
"Hotblack?" said Ford. 
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's body had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended. 
"Kid ..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest. 
"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't come further up the man's body. 
"Beat it," said the man. 
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who are you?" 
The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came up with an answer. 
"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you get it beaten for you." 
"Now listen," said Ford nervously , he wished his head would stop spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation , "Now listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and ..." 
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as an eyelash. 
"... and ..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word to say after "and". 
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He said it. 
"And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged." 
"Now wait a minute," said Ford. 
"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr Desiato speaks to no one!" 
"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself," said Ford. 
"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard. 
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed 

to have the facts on his side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen interest in 
Ford's welfare. 
"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?" 
The bodyguard told him. 


Chapter 17 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet , or more frequently around a completely different planet. 
Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. 
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. 
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. 
Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin. 
"Gotta have some food," said Ford. 
"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?" 
Ford waggled his head noncommittally. 
"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah." 
"What'd he say?" 
"Well, not a lot really. He's ... er ..." 
"Yeah?" 
"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit down." 
He sat down. 
The waiter approached. 
"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to meet the Dish of the Day?" 
"Huh?" said Ford. 
"Huh?" said Arthur. 
"Huh?" said Trillian. 
"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat." 
In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a 

curtain and oblivion looked him in the face. It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and 
gave the impression that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner. He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere 
more healthy. He prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes. 
A bell rang. 
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands brushed limply over some of the one 
million rainbow-coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone through the door. 

In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into 

the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage. 
Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up 
to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment 
bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay 
window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there weren't any there, and 
waited for the applause to die down. 

He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear, but seemed to extend 
some way beyond the mere confines of his face. 
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much. Thank you so much." 
He eyed them with a twinkling eye. 

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!" 
With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause. With another gesture he cut it. 
"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max Quordlepleen ..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from the very very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar , where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen , and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!" 
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further. On every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. 
Max's voice was hushed as he continued. 
"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!" 
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. 
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, 
, a hideous light, 
, a boiling, pestilential light, 
, a light that would have disfigured hell. 
The Universe was coming to an end. 
For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. 
"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said, "this is it." 
The band struck up again. 
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!" 
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. 
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed. Max 

began his round of the tables, swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. 
A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine 
type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its 
lips. 

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I am the main Dish of the Day. May I 
interest you in parts of my body?" It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more 
comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. 

Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford 
Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal, "Braised in a white wine sauce?" 
"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper. 
"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly, "nobody else's is mine to offer." 

Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal's shoulder appreciatively. 
"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so 
there's a lot of good meat there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud. It 
swallowed the cud again. 

"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added. 
"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered Trillian to Ford. 
"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean anything." 
"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most revolting thing I've ever heard." 
"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his attention to the animal's enormous 

rump. 
"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless." 
"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten," said Zaphod. 
"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe 

it is the point. I don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just ... er ..." 
The Universe raged about him in its death throes. 
"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered. 
"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must be very rich and tender by now, I've 

been force-feeding myself for months." 
"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically. 

"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur. 
"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have green salad?" 
"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are very clear on that point. Which is why it was 

eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to 
be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am." 
It managed a very slight bow. 
"Glass of water please," said Arthur. 
"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare steaks 

please, and hurry. We haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years." 
The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. 
"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just nip off and shoot myself." 
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. 
"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane." 
It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen. 
A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed 

straight into them without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into hers. 
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill. 
"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating 

you?" 
And the band played on. 
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted. The air was filled with talk of this and 

that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish. 
"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having one last wonderful time?" 
"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when comedians ask them if they're having a 
wonderful time. 
"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as the photon storms gather in swirling 

crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle 
back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience." 
He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. 
"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing penultimate about this one." 

He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there was was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the Restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time's furthest edge , and back again. This "night" was good though, the audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. 
"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep 
of creation becomes extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'." 
He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would not have dared cleat its throat. 
"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness. Oblivion. Absolute nothing ..." 
His eyes glittered again , or did they twinkle?" 

"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!" 
The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. 
He could play the audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He followed 
on. 

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about having a hangover in the morning  

because there won't be any more mornings!" 
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the sky, going through the same dead 
routine every night, but his glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one 
professional trusts another. 

"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of 
doom and futility here this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties." 

He pulled a card from his pocket. 
"Do we have ..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we have a party here from the 
Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?" 

A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. He peered around trying to find them. 
"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer. 
He got it, as he always did. 
"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads , and no cheating, remember this is a very solemn moment." 
He lapped up the laughter. 
"And do we also have, do we have ... a party of minor deities from the Halls of Asgard?" 
Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across the stage. A small group of hairy men 

with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. 
Hasbeens, he thought to himself. 

"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said. 
They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very thin lipped smile. 
"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives from Sirius B, are they here?" 
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other and started throwing rolls at 

the stage. They yapped and barked unintelligibly. 
"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?" 
"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face, "finally I believe we 

have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the Second 

Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon." 
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping 
mineral water nervously, and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the spotlight 
was turned on them. 

"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said he'd come again, and he's kept you waiting a 

long time, so let's hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes left!" 
The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter 
which swept over them. 

Max restrained his audience. 

"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence meant. No, I know we shouldn't make fun of 
deeply held beliefs, so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ..." 
The audience clapped respectfully. 
"... wherever he's got to!" 
He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre of the stage. 
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. 
"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you here tonight , no isn't it though? Yes, 

absolutely marvellous. Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of everything, and then return home to your own eras ... and raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for what you know to be right ... it really gives one hope for the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them, "that we know it hasn't got one ..." 
Arthur turned to Ford , he hadn't quite got this place worked out in his mind. 
"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end ... don't we go with it?" 
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one. 

"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this dive you get held in this sort of amazing 

force-shielded temporal warp thing. I think." 
"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup he'd managed to get from the waiter to 
replace his steak. 

"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you." 

He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. 

"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a 

transductional mode in the matter curve ..." 
It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to interrupt him. 
"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said. 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon ..." he found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this 

spoon ..." but found it rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork ..." 
"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod. 
"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say ... why don't we say that this wine glass is the 

temporal Universe ..." 
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?" 
"Did I do that?" 
"Yes." 
"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean ... I mean, look, do you know , do you know how the Universe 

actually began for a kick off?" 
"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on any of this. 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A large round bath. And it's made of 

ebony." 
"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons." 
"Doesn't matter." 
"So you keep saying." 
"Listen." 
"Alright." 
"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's ebony. And it's conical." 

"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of ..." 
"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or 

sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when it's full, you pull 
the plug out ... are you listening?" 
"I'm listening." 
"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you see, out of the plughole." 
"I see." 
"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" 
"Tell me the clever bit." 
"I'll tell you the clever bit." 
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was. 
"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening." 
"Clever." 
"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is 

that you then thread the film in the projector ... backwards!" 
"Backwards?" 
"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, you just sit and watch it, and everything 

just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?" 
"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur. 
"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax." 
He reached for his wine glass. 
"Where's my wine glass?" he said. 
"It's on the floor." 
"Ah." 
Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching the 

table carrying a portable telephone. 
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk. 
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly understood. 

Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug his forelock, missed by six inches and 
slid under the table. 
"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter. 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak. 
"There is a phone call for you." 
"Hey, what?" 
"A phone call, sir." 
"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?" 
One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in. 
"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and carried on. 
There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He shouldn't have made such a conspicuous 
entrance. Hell, why not though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's no one watching 
you have it? 

"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in." 

"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod, "Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude 
when I'm concerned." 
"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel." 
"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod. 
"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously. 
"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up 

there, kid," he said to him, "I may need you." 
"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question, sir ..." 
"Metal?" 
"Yes, sir." 
"Did you say metal?" 
"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question ..." 
"OK, carry on." 
"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia. It seems 

you left here somewhat precipitately." 

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just arrived here." 
"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left 
here." 
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other. 
"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left here?" 
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. 
"Precisely, sir," he said. 
"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod. 
"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again, "where exactly is here?" 

"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B." 
"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and came to the Restaurant at the End of the 
Universe." 

"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well, "the one was 
constructed on the ruins of the other." 
"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but not in space." 
"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree will you?" 
Arthur bristled. 
"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod. 
"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, sir." 

Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent. 
"You jumped forward ... I believe five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years whilst staying in 
exactly the same place," explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally 
won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds. 

"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly 
what it did. Give or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we never moved. Neat." 
They all agreed this was very neat. 
"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?" 
"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian. 
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads. 

"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B." 
"When was this?" 

"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, 
hand me the rap-rod, Plate Captain." 
The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion. 
"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said. 
"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your 

bums don't fall off." 
"Indeed, sir." 
"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you doing, kid?" 
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. 
Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone. 
"It's Marvin," he said. 
"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a great time. Food, wine, a little personal 

abuse and the Universe going foom. Where can we find you?" 
Again the pause. 
"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm 

only a menial robot." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?" 
"'Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me, 'open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, 

can you pick up that piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am, brain the size of a 

planet and they ask me to ..." 

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all. 
"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of 
water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait 
a minute." 

"Er, hey, Marvin ..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line. 

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. 

"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at us." 
"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, "I hope that gave satisfaction ..." 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you are?" 
"I'm in the car park," said Marvin. 
"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?" 
"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?" 
"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down." 
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the 

bill. 
"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on down." 
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur. 
"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum." 
"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big moment." 
"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." 
"A what?" 
"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy." 
Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the Restaurant to the 

exit. Their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies. 
"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is in the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, 

where if you look very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the ultra-violet. 
Anyone here from Hastromil?" 
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back. 
"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry about whether you left the gas on 

now." 


Chapter 18 
The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless weaved his way through it. 

Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle standing to one side of the 
entrance hall. 
"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur. 

"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot. Lights flashed, gases swirled. 
"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we going?" 
"Down to the car park, come on." 
"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us straight back to the Heart of Gold." 
"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I don't want to play his games. Let's see what 

we can find." 
A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter took them down deep into the 

substrata beneath the Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make 
them happy as well as take them down. 
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold stale air hit them. 
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering 

lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy throughout 

the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience. 
They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space 
that stretched off into the dim distance. 

It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian mass production models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings of the very rich. 
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be clear on this point , avarice is definitely what it was. 
"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there." 
They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small 
rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser. 

At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy. 
"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey, kid, are we pleased to see you." 
Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what 
it did. 
"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is." 
"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships. Ford went with him. 
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. 

"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely, "hanging around 

waiting for us all this time." 
"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand five hundred and seventy-nine years," 
said Marvin, "I counted them." 

"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, felling , quite correctly in Marvin's view , that it was a slightly 

foolish thing to say. 
"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the 
worst too. The third million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline." 

He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something, and then interrupted. 

"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down," he said and paused again. 

Trillian cleared her throat. 

"Is that ..." 

"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago," continued Marvin. 

Again the pause. 

"Oh d ..." 

"And that was with a coffee machine." 

He waited. 

"That's a ..." 

"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate tone. 

Trillian talked to Arthur instead. 

Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of which he very much liked the look, 

several such things in fact. 
"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little star trolleys ..." 
Zaphod looked and liked. 
The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It 

was not much to look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of 

thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-drive 

engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, however, was a 

heat-sink. 
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this heat-sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar 
flares that burst out from its surface. Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous , those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club's Apres-Flare parties. 
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on. 
"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the black sunbusters ..." 
Again, the star buggy was a small ship , a totally misnamed one in fact, because the one thing it couldn't 

manage was interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to something it 

wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed on. The next one was a big one and thirty yards long , a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also rich enough not to take it seriously." It was wonderfully hideous. 
"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive, perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job." 
He examined every inch. 
"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man 
has no shame." 

"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and 
this thing just strolled past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just incredible." 
Zaphod whistled appreciatively. 
"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta." 
"Yeah, right?" 
"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow." 

Ford looked round the other side. 
"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted on this side. A bursting sun , Disaster 
Area's trade mark. This must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song you know 
which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt 
ships though." 

Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to 
Hotblack Desiato's limo. His mouths hung open. 
"That," he said, "that ... is really bad for the eyes ..." 

Ford looked. He too stood astonished. 
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. 
There was just one remarkable thing about it. 
"It's so ... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its shape ... light just seems to fall into it!" 
Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. 
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it. 

"Your eyes just slide off it ..." said Ford in wonder. It was an emotional moment. He bit his lip. 
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed , or more accurately like a man who wanted 
to possess. His hand reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it again. 
His hand stopped again. 

"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice. 

Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. 

"You ... you can't ..." he said. 

"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover ..." 

He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads did , the other stayed gazing in awe at the 

ship. 
"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said. 
"You mean ... er ..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?" 
"No." 
"Nor do I." 
"But we're going to, aren't we?" 
"How can we not?" 
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself together. 
"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe will have ended and all the Captain 

Creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourge-mobiles." 
"Zaphod," said Ford. 
"Yeah?" 
"How do we do it?" 

"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called. 
Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, 
Marvin turned round to answer the summons. 
"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you." 
Marvin trudged towards them. 
"I won't enjoy it," he said. 
"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life stretching out ahead of you." 

"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin. 
"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's going to be excitement and adventure and 
really wild things." 

"Sounds awful," Marvin said. 

"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you ..." 

"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?" 

"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He was keeping at least three eyes on the 

entrance. Time was short. 

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't 

got one." 

He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung open. 

Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening. 

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away again. 

Arthur and Trillian clustered round. 

"What's happening?" asked Arthur. 

"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship." 

"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod. 

"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black ..." 

In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn't be any more 

moments. 

All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect. 
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert. 
"Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way. 
"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?" 
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing. 
"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard. 
Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply. Supernaturally, however, he did. 
On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. 
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. 
"It's time we get going, Mr Desiato," muttered the bodyguard, "don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking forward to it?" 
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and dropped again. 
"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been great. You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack. 
"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in the limo. OK?" 
The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself. 
The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the Restaurant. 
"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air. Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords. Max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would do. His agent would have to sort it out. 
"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!" 
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them , and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown. 
"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?" 
At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying. 
Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. 
"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!" 
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the Prophet. 
Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. 
"Er ..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment." 
He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. 
"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min-" 
And so the Universe ended. 

Chapter 19 
One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book, the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws. 
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. 
Here is a sample: 
The Universe , some information to help you live in it. 
1~Area: Infinite. 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word "Infinite". 
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here. 
2~Imports: None. 
It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from. 
3~Exports: None. 
See imports. 
4~Population: None. 
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination. 
5~Monetary Units: None. 
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flaninian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination. 
6~Art: None. 
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror big enough , see point one. 
7~Sex: None. 
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied. 
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated. For further information see Guide Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide. 

Chapter 20 
The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing , there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist. 
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone. 
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent. 
In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack Desiato, propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. 
They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system, moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod Beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. 
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past. 
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this: 
The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. 
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question "How can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?" and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?" 
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question. 
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. 
"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent. 
"Badly," said Ford Prefect. 
"Where are we going?" said Trillian. 
"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent. 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. 
"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent, ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of 

control." 
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod tried to wrest control from the 
autopilot. The engined howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket. 

"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?" 
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was black, the seats , which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned , were black, the control panel was black, the instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were black, the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black. 
"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths," offered Trillian. 
"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur. 
"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed." 
In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, 

and tax-deductible condition. 
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. 
"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick." 
"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through time." 
"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be ill." 
"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about this place." 
"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?" snapped Arthur. 
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over to Arthur. 
"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do, right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, 

right?" 
"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about that." 
"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in the right quarters. And it's all locked up in 

that head thing of yours." 
"Yes but ..." 

"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our fingers on that we can hold every shrink in 
the Galaxy up to ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint." 

Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. 
"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know? They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever 
is Forty-two, how am I supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, what's six 
times seven?" 

Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with excitement. 

"Forty-two!" he cried. 

Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. 

"Yes," he said patiently," I know that." 

Zaphod's faces fell. 

"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all," said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to 

know." 
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did the big firework." 
"We have a thing on Earth ..." began Arthur. 
"Had," corrected Zaphod. 
"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know." 
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. 
"I know," said Marvin. 
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with. 
"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk." 
"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very 

interested in knowing that." 
"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?" 
"Yes," said Marvin. 
Arthur stared in astonishment. 
"And ...?" he said. 
"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse." 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 
"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up." 
"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment, "Why should I want to make 

anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it." 

"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to 
this misbegotten creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?" 
Marvin's head swivelled back to her. 
"You didn't ask," he said simply. 
"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round to look at him. 
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the engine pitch settled down to a gentle 

hum. 
"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out the controls of this boat?" 
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we just go to wherever this ship is going and 

get off it fast." 
"Yeah, right," said Zaphod. 
"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and 

switched himself off. 
"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while ship that is giving any reading is worrying 

me. If it is what I think it is, and if it's saying what I think it's saying, then we've already gone too far back 
into the past. Maybe as much as two million years before our own time." 
Zaphod shrugged. 
"Time is bunk," he said. 
"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur. 
"Me," said Zaphod. 
"No. Who it really belongs to." 
"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right? Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship 

is mine, OK?" 
"Tell the ship that," said Arthur. 
Zaphod strode over to the console. 

"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner speaking to ..." 
He got no further. Several things happened at once. 
The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real space. 
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time trip now lit up. 
A large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them. 
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others. 
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen. 

Chapter 21 
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. 
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have survived the tuning up. 
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them. 
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang drum complex. 
It was going to be a noisy show. 
Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle. Hotblack Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard. 
A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The bass player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board. 
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend. 
The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the 

drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right. 
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker 
channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship. 

Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and listened to the voices on the monitor 
speakers. 
"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel fifteen ..." 
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. 
"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice. 

A third voice cut in. 
"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage 
computer on line?" 

A computer voice answered. 

"On line," it said. 

"Take control of the black ship." 

"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby." 

"Testing channel twenty." 

Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sub-ether receiver before the next 

mind-pulverizing noise hit them. He stood there quivering. 
"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive mean?" 
"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the sun. Sun ... Dive. It's very simple to 

understand. What do you expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?" 

"How do you know ..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is 

Hotblack Desiato's stuntship?" 

"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him." 

"The why ... didn't ... you ... tell us!" 

"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things." 

"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed. 

"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin. 

On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a public broadcast, which now echoed 
round the cabin. "... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm standing here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about. 
"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area met with the environmentalists at 
lunchtime, and had them all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ..." 
Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford. 
"You know what I'm thinking?" he said. 
"I think so," said Ford. 
"Tell me what you think I'm thinking." 
"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship." 
"I think you're right," said Zaphod. 
"I think you're right," said Ford. 
"How?" said Arthur. 
"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking." 
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 

"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford. 
It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with, on his first encounter with 
human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, 
as it 'It's a nice day," or "You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die." 

His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up. 

After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this , "If human 
beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working." 
In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcebron people of Kakrafoon. 
The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighboring races by 

being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the Galaxy. 
As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative, a 
Galactic Tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy. Consequently, in order 

to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon had suddenly become. 
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a Disaster Area concert. 
The timing of the concert was critical. 
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven 

seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to 

travel out to Kakrafoon. 
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that Ford Prefect had completed his 
search of the other compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. 

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel. Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out. 
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed. 
"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?" 
"None," said Ford. 
Zaphod gibbered. 
"Did you count them?" he yelled. 
"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on the radio?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch of people on board, and they said to say 

'hi' to everybody." 
Ford goggled. 
"Didn't you tell them who we were?" 
"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something about a restaurant bill and my executors." 
Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control console. 
"Does none of this function?" he said savagely. 
"All overridden." 
"Smash the autopilot." 
"Find it first. Nothing connects." 

There was a moment's cold silence. 
Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped suddenly. 
"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?" 
Another moment passed. 
Slowly, the others turned to face him. 
"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only bring it up because ..." 
"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?" 
"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word 'emergency', above the word 'system' and beside the sign saying 'out of order'." 
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it. 
A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured. 
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns." at five times the price. 
"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to sort through the tangle of wiring. 
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished. 
"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no guidance system. A matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you ... well, anywhere." 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen. 
"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go." 
"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go. Someone would have to stay and operate it." 
A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. 
"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?" 
"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin. 
A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax. 
The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. 
Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. 
Those , very few , who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground. 
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. 
A spokesman for Disaster Area , the one who had had all the environmentalists shot , was later quoted as saying that it had been "a good gig". 
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space. 

Chapter 22 
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had, but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. 
Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth , when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass , the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another , particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short of fish. 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news. 
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi-Werld III: 
Aldebaran's great, OK, 
Algol's pretty neat, 
Betelgeuse's pretty girls, 
Will knock you off your feet. 
They'll do anything you like, 
Real fast and then real slow, 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 
Then I don't want to go. 
Singing, 
Take me apart, take me apart, 
What a way to roam, 
And if you have to take me apart to get me there, 
I'd rather stay at home. 
Sirius is paved with gold 
So I've heard it said 
By nuts who then go on to say 
"See Tau before you're dead." 
I'll gladly take the high road 
Or even take the low, 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

Then I, for one, won't go. 
Singing, 
Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head, 
And if you try to take me apart to get me there, 
I'll stay right here in bed. 
I teleported home one night, 
With Ron and Sid and Meg, 
Ron stole Meggie's heart away, 
And I got Sidney's leg. 
Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, 

carefully, he stood up. 
"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect. 
Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty. 
"Where are we?" gasped Arthur. 
Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both 

directions. The outer steel wall , which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued , curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. 
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall. It was several layers deep, 
yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars. 
"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said. 
Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. 
"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?" 

Ford shrugged. 
"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere. An unprogrammed teleport can throw 
you light years in any direction. Judging by the way I feel I should think we've travelled a very long way 
indeed." 

"How do you feel?" "Bad." 
"Do you think they're ..." 

"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and no way we can do anything about it. Do 
what I do." 
"What?" 
"Don't think about it." 
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. 

He took a deep breath. 
"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly. 
"Where?" 
"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!" 
Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance. It was the 

muffled sound of pounding footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. 
"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved , in opposite directions. 
"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from." 
"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way." 
"They're not, they're ..." 
They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. They both agreed with each other. 

They both set off into opposite directions again. 
Fear gripped them. 
From both directions the noise was getting louder. 
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried 

along it. It was dark, immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed. 
They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor they went, the louder became the 
sound of pounding feet. They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of ... , then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together. 
However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the arm. 
"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps. 
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the 
drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them. 

Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber. 
Ford Prefect stared after them. 
"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors. 
"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent. 
"Joggers," said Ford prefect with a shrug. 
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was very short, and ended at a large steel 

door. Ford examined it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide. 
The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. 
And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins. 


Chapter 23 
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. 
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault. 
"Wild," he said. 
"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously stepping down after him. 
"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?" 
On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was , something that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned. 
Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch. 
Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and 
started to rub furiously at something. 

"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur, "It's frosted over." 
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. To Arthur they looked like the footprints 
of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly 
recognized an early form of Galactic Eezeereed. 

"It says 'Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer Second Class' , and a serial 
number." 
"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone sanitizer?" 
"Best kind." 
"But what's he doing here?" 

Ford peered through the top at the figure within. 
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always made people think he'd 
been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest. 

He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk towel work and he announced: 
"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!" 
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive; the 

one after that contained a second-hand car salesman, third class. 

An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's attention, and he squatted down to unfasten 
it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him. 
A thought occurred to Arthur. 
"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so cold?" 
"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the hatchway open. The gas poured down 

through it. "Why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead 
bodies through space?" 
"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible. 
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up again. 
"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there." 
"Fifteen million," said a voice. 
"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot." 

"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up. Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits." 
"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not making any other move. 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?" 
Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with." 
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. 
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them. As he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance. 
He gestured at the door. 
"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the buttons. 
Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. 
"Move!" screamed their captor. 
Arthur moved. 
Ford shrugged and moved. 
In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty-four dreamless sleeps. 

Chapter 24 
"Er, captain ..." 
"Yes, Number One?" 
"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two." 
"Oh, dear." 
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild 

irritation. From where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them the 

vast panorama of stars through which they were moving , a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through the Galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion. 
He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was still standing nearby. 
Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still moving, Captain." "Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote. Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at Number One. 
"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners ..." 
The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way. 
"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's always wanted some." 
Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it. 
They entered. 
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them: to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before their own time. 
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. 
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump. 
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two approached it. 
"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth , a difficult trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it. 
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath. 
"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, "having a nice day?" 
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was. 
"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir!" he yapped. 
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. 
"Er ... hello," they said. 
The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a chap doing what he's best at. 
"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up, having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in the fridge Number one." 
"Certainly sir." 
It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85\% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary water server at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds. 
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs. 
Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with frustration. 
"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed. 
The Captain peered at him in bemusement. 
"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked. 
"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came here!" 
"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?" 
"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!" 
The Captain looked at them doubtfully. 
"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to drink." 
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. 
"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin ..." He jabbed Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun. 
"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently. 
"What do you want to drink!!!" Number Two screamed. 
"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What about you Arthur?" 
Arthur blinked. 
"What? Oh, er, yes," he said. 
"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two. 
"Oh, with please," said Ford. 
"Lemon??!!" 
"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?" 
"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body quaking with apoplectic fury. 
"Er, Number Two ..." said the Captain softly. 
"Sir?!" 
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a relaxing bath." 
Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the Shouting and Killing People trade as 

cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your 

glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem. He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs. 
"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror. 
The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile. 
"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said. 
Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur lowered his. 
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath pedestal. He patted it. 
"Nice," he lied. 
He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he grinned. It was safe. 
"Er ..." he said to the Captain. 
"Yes?" said the Captain. 
"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is in fact?" 
A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round. 
It was the first officer. 
"Your drinks," he said. 
"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised 

to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda. 
"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip, "the bodies. In the hold." 
"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise. 
Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for granted, he thought. Could it be that the 

Captain doesn't know he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? 
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck. 
Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, but only for an instant: his eyes were 

constantly on the move. The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling 
benignly. 
"Bodies?" said the Captain again. 
Ford licked his lips. 
"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives, you know, down in the hold." 
The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed. 
"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen. They're going to be revived." 
Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked. 

Arthur seemed to come out of a trance. 
"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he said. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, 

personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name 
them. We're going to colonize another planet." 
Ford wobbled very slightly. 
"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain. 
"What, with that lot?" said Arthur. 
"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're 

the 'B' Ark you see. Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?" 

Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of 

pleasure. 

"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more drinks of course." 

Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top. 

"What," he said, "is a 'B' Ark?" 

"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck. 

"Yes," said Ford, "but ..." 

"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet, the world from which we have come, 

was, so to speak, doomed." 
"Doomed?" 
"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and 

go and settle on another planet." 
Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied grunt. 
"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur. 
"What did you say dear fellow?" 
"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on." 
"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, you see, three Arks in Space, and ... 

I'm not boring you am I?" 
"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating." 

"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have someone else to talk to for a change." 
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror, like a pair 

of flies briefly distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat. 
"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain, "is that you end up just talking to yourself a 
lot, which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what you're going to say next." 

"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise. 
The Captain thought for a moment. 
"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway , where's the soap?" He fished around and found it. 
"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first ship, the 'A' ship, would go all the brilliant 

leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and into the third, or 'C' ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the 'B' ship , that's us , would go everyone else, the middlemen you see." 
He smiled happily at them. 
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little bathing tune. 
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his world's most exciting and prolific 

jingle writer (who was currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each other's eyes. 
"Er ..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet then?" 
"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or 

something. Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was." "Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic 
swarm of twelve foot piranha bees. Wasn't that it?" 
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in. "That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in 
imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!" 
"Oh really ..." said Ford Prefect. 
"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that 

would boil oceans, claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ..." "And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?" inquired Arthur. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean." 
"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important. And the other ships, er ... they followed 
on after you did they?" 
For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the 
huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance. 

"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago ... but they must be behind us somewhere." 
He peered off into the distance again. 
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown. 
"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat ..." 
"Ah yes ..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice, "the goat ..." His eyes passed 

over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who raised his eyebrows at him. 
"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now that I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean does it strike you as odd Number Two?" 
"Errrrrrrrrrrr ..." said Number Two. 
"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the 
drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ..." 

"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain, "because our trajectory thingy was preset before 

we left Golgafrincham, I think partly because I'm not very good with figures ..." 
"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly losing patience with the whole 
charade, "When are you meant to be reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?" 

"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second now. It's probably time I was getting out of 
this bath in fact. Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?" 
"So we're actually going to land in a minute?" 
"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no ... er ..." 

"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply. 
"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we 
were programmed to crash on it." 

"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur. 
"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember at the moment. It was something to with ... er ..." 
Ford exploded. 
"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted. 
"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason." 

Chapter 25 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit. This was its history. 
And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at them. 
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great Song Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern. 
The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. 
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back. 
All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone. 

Chapter 26 
That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant little green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western spiral arm of the Galaxy. 
In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process. 
Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors , the detritus of its descent , flashed across the sky. 
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths. 
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land. 
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. 
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal. 
Two figures moved further afield. 
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part. 
"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur. 
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. 
"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said. 
"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and harmony?" said Arthur. 
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. 
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work. Never mind." 
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened. 
"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a while. 
"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even survival. Strange but true." 
A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settles again on the scene 
of misery below them. 
"I think they'll manage for a while," he said. 
Arthur looked up sharply. 
"Why do you say that?" he said. 
Ford shrugged. 
"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further questions. 

"Look," he said suddenly. Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving , or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. 
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. 
"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement." 
"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment, "but I'm off." 
He sat a while in silence. 
After a while this seemed to require comment. 
"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said Arthur. 
"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence." 
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small box. Ford had already 

introduced this box as a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided into two parts , the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the "everything else" category. 
"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing. 
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth sausage. "Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are no transmissions of any kind within light 
years of this benighted tip? Are you listening to me?" 
"What?" said Arthur. 
"We're in trouble," said Ford. 

"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him. 
"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field , in which case we just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. Coming?" 
He picked up his gear and strode off. 
Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing. 
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford. 

Chapter 27 
"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor. 
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. 
"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into. He found one and 
slumped into it. 

"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting?" 
Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle 
of old Janx spirit. He took a long pull at it. 
"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done, alright? I'm free to go and do what the hell I 
like and lie on beaches and stuff?" 

"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop. 

"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on 
our ship?" 
"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man who rules the Universe." 
"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, "a social climber." 


Chapter 28 
The major problem , one of the major problems, for there are several , one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves 
made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the 

summary: people are a problem. 
And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and 
palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they're not. 

And somewhere in the shadows behind them , who? 
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to? 


Chapter 29 
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular , nowhere, that is, that 
could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this 
galaxy have a key , it was raining. 

It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, 

it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath. 
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this 
patch of scrubby land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the 
seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there. 

The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went largely unnoticed by its 

occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged. 
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof. His 
clothes were shabby, his back was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. 

In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched table, an old mattress, some cushions and 

a stove that was small but warm. 
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was currently the focus of the man's 
attention. He bent his shambling form over it. 

"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo ... pussy want his fish? Nice piece of fish ... 

pussy want it?" 
The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man 
was holding out, and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. 

"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think," said the man. Doubt crept into his voice. 
"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I tell?" 
He proffered the fish again. 
"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I don't get involved." He sighed. 
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?" 

He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. 
"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish. 
"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because in my mind you will waste away if you don't." 
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together. He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest. 
He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of the bones of his hip. 
"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I imagine I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in their six black ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see pussy?" 
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. 
"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing songs to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. 
"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just think they're asking me questions." 
He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see what it was like. 
"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they've left me." 
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it. 
"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator." 
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the calculator aside. 
"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he said, "To come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell." 
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. 
"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last. "A big white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who say they come from so far away. 
Never a big white one. Perhaps six small black ones can look like one big white one at certain times. 

Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more likely." 
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the mattress. He poured in a measure from 
his whisky bottle. He sat again. 

"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said. 

A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart of Gold. 

Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces. 

"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain. 

"Yes," said Zarniwoop. 

"That shack?" 

"Yes." 

"Weird," said Zaphod. 

"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have come to the wrong place. You can't rule 

the Universe from a shack." 

They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through, at the door. They knocked. They 

shivered. 

The door opened. 

"Hello?" said the man. 

"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe ..." 

"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod. 

The man smiled at him. 

"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?" 

Zaphod looked at him in astonishment. 

"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?" 

"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel about it might be an altogether different 

matter. If you feel warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in." 
They went in. 
They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with 

delight. 

"Hey, er ..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?" 
The man looked at them doubtfully. 
"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name." He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the 
table and Zaphod lay on the mattress. 
"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat. 
"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions." 
"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you like." 
"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod. 
"You'd better ask him," said the man. 
"Does he talk?" said Zaphod. 
"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very unreliable." 
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket. 
"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?" 
"How can I tell?" said the man. 
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. 
"How long have you been doing this?" 
"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?" 
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what he had been expecting. 
"Yes," he said. 
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy 

between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?" 
Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden clothes. 
"So you answer all questions like this?" he said. 
The man answered quickly. 
"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things. More I cannot say." 

Zaphod laughed happily. 
"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx spirit. He leaped up and handed the bottle to 
the ruler of the Universe, who took it with pleasure. 
"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is." 
"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they? In ships ..." 

"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian. 
"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them? About people's lives, about worlds, 
about economies, about wars, about everything going on out there in the Universe?" 

"Out there?" said the man, "out where?" 

"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door. 

"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man politely, "the door's closed." 

The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. 

"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your 

responsibilities by saying they don't exist!" 
The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst Zarniwoop quivered with anger. 
"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't trust the thinking of a man who takes the 

Universe , if there is one , for granted." 
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. 
"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My Universe is my eyes and my ears. 

Anything else is hearsay." 
"But don't you believe in anything?" 
The man shrugged and picked up his cat. 
"I don't understand what you mean," he said. 
"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the lives and fates of millions of 

people? This is all monstrously wrong!" 
"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And neither, I suspect, have you. They only 

exist in words we hear. It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they know, if 
they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes and ears." 
Trillian said: 
"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment." 

She left and walked into the rain. 
"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop. 
"I have no opinion. How can I say?" 
"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped out. 
Outside, he said to her: 
"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?" 
"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain. 
Inside, Zarniwoop continued. 
"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?" 
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard the faint sound of the ship's 

engines starting he spoke to cover it. 

"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel 
man." 
"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say 'The Lord'. You believe in something!" 
"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, "I call him The Lord. I am kind to him." 
"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you know he exists? How do you know he 

knows you to be kind, or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?" 

"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to 
what appears to be a cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired." 
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. 
"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly. 
"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back into his chair and refilling his whisky glass. 
"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!" 
"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ..." 
"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There was no ship. The rain continued to churn 

the mud. There was no sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain. He turned and 

ran back to the shack and found it locked. The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various 
noises continued outside, but he didn't know whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react. 

Chapter 30 
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens.O.Matic totally silent. 
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he liked it here. 
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those before moving on. 
So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going. 
Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after that another. 
A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short. 
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches. 
Ford and Arthur held their breath. 
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. 
Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. 
For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations. 
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen. 
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. 
"Hello," he said. 
The women drew their children slightly closer to them. 
The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome , it was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome. 
One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. 
"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly. 
This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and that the Babel Fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. 
"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village." 
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm this. 
"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug," continued the man-creature. 
"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it it would make them all very happy." 
"So what do we do?" 
"I think we make them happy," said Ford. 
Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business. 
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path , berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears. 
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them. 
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when you're going to die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food." 
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. 
"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er ..." 
"Yes?" said Arthur. 
"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it," said Ford. 
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which looked like pears. The things which 

looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice 
cream commercials. 
"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said. 
"Maybe that's what they want us to do." 
"Alright, look at it this way ..." 

"Sounds good so far." 
"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either they want to feed us or to poison us. If it's 
poisonous and we don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If we don't eat, we lose out either 
way." 

"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one." 
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears. 
"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said Ford. 
"Eh?" 
"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?" 
"Yes of course I do." 
"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys, oh, but 

don't eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 'Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it." 
"Why not?" 
"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the 
pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end." 

"What are you talking about?" 
"Never mind, eat the fruit." 
"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden." 
"Eat the fruit." 

"Sounds quite like it too." 
Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. 
"It's a pear," he said. 
A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect turned round and called out. 
"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind." 
They went on their way. 
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone. 
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started. 
Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left. 
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them. 
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. 
On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect , the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly. 
Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their bones. 
They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian. 
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational , and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. 
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling. 
After a while an animal , a deer perhaps , would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck. 
"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how to generate the right smell." 

Chapter 31 
A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice , fjords. 
For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty. 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly. 
It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea 

smashing itself against the craggy promontories. 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford again. 
Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried faintly in the wind. 
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. 

He was tense with excitement , his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's. 
"Look," he said, "look!" 
Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice. 
"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it." 
"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it. Look!" 
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. 
Arthur peered , he saw nothing but vague shadows. 
"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again." 
Arthur moved back and looked again. 
"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking for?" 
And suddenly he saw it. 
"You see it?" 
He saw it. 

His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground. 
The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn't read Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. 
It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. 
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on. 

Chapter 32 
A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended. 
The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine , perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged. 
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look forward to. 
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something he looked forward to as well. 
What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things: the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all). 
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting. 
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon committee meetings were his 
favourite. Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country-rock singer's. 
He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for almost a week now, and Ford had decided 
to stir things up a bit. The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford's eyes narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could they? 
In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose above the hubbub. 
"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order if that's at all possible. Is that alright with everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a minute. When you're all ready." The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in 
some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw 
some leaves to him. If there was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. 
The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him. 
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry. The 
man turned to speak. 
Ford dropped down out of the tree. 
"Hi there," he said. 
The crowd swivelled round. 
"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?" 
"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd prepared. He decided he'd better be a little 

stronger on the subject. 
"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you news ..." 
"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had a hot bath in weeks." 
Ford refused to be headed off. 

"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest you." 
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted. 
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile. 
"Now, come on," he said. 
"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a management consultant of many years' standing, 

I must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure." 
Ford looked round the crowd. 
"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet." 
"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant. 
"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock." 
The management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for. 
"Well, call it a chair," he said testily. 
"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford. 
"You obviously have no conception," said the management consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour 

of good old fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods." 
"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford. 
A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. 
"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion." 
"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser. 
"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant. 
"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." He plonked himself down on the ground to see how 

long he could keep his temper. 
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise. 
"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five hundred and seventy-third meeting of the 

colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix ..." 
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. 
"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three committee meetings and you haven't even 

discovered fire yet!" 

"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to examine the agenda sheet ..." 
"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily. 
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford. 
"... you ... will ... see ..." continued the girl firmly, "that we are having a report from the hairdressers' Fire 

Development Sub-Committee today." 

"Oh ... ah -" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next Tuesday do?" "Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What are you going to do? What are your 
thoughts on fire development?" 
"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was a couple of sticks ..." 
"So what have you done with them?" 
Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford. 
Ford held them up for all to see. 
"Curling tongs," he said. 
The crowd applauded. 
"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day." 
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless. They 

applauded. 
"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the girl, "When you've been in marketing as 
long as I have you'll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly 

researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it 
has for them." 
The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford. 
"Stick it up your nose," he said. 
"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the girl, "Do people want fire that can be 

applied nasally?" 
"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd. 
"Yes!" shouted some. 
"No!" shouted others happily. 
They didn't know, they just thought it was great. 

"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project." 
"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty there." 

"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean, difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in 
the entire Universe!" 
The marketing girl soured him with a look. 
"Alright, Mr Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us what colour it should have." 
The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down 

again. 
"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?" 
As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing. 

The crowd couldn't believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. 
"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two , for he was their leader , "Permission to report sir!" 
"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot springs?" said the Captain 
despondently. 
"No sir!" 
"Thought you wouldn't." 
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath. 
"We have discovered another continent!" 
"When was this?" 
"It lies across the sea ..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes significantly, "to the east!" 
"Ah." 
Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his head. This is going to be great, 

thought the crowd. 
"We have declared war on it!" 
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing , this was beyond all expectation. 
"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!" 

He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem. 
"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant." 
Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay. Instead 

he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two. 
"War?" he said. 
"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. 
"On the next continent?" 
"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!" 
"But there's no one even living there yet!" 
Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point. 
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitos that 

hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or 

rolled newspapers. 

"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have left an open-ended ultimatum." 

"What?" 

"And blown up a few military installations." 

The Captain leaned forward out of his bath. 

"Military installations Number Two?" he said. 

For a moment the eyes wavered. 

"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright ... trees." 

The moment of uncertainty passed , his eyes flickered like whips over his audience. 

"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!" 
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had 
now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught up 
and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing. 

Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. 

"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations had died down. 
"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl. 
"Oh yes?" said Ford. 
"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous 

cavemen of the area." 
"They're not cavemen." 
"They look like cavemen." 
"Do they live in caves?" 
"Well ..." 
"They live in huts." 
"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a wag from the crowd. 
Ford rounded on him angrily. 
"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying out?" 
On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many 

natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were stricken and listless, as 

if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with an 

infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them. 
"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?" 
"Er ... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out the wag again. 
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd. 
"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since we've arrived that they've started dying out!" 
"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant 

twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very committed." 
"He should be," muttered Ford. 
"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was beginning to nod off, "that he wants to 

make one about you next, Captain." 
"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully nice." 
"He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command ..." 
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. 

"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck." 
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd. 
All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary. At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he would merely pretend that the last half hour 
hadn't happened. 
He rose to his feet. 
"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy ..." 
"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!" 
The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied. 
"Fiscal policy ..." he repeated, "that is what I said." 
"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you actually produces anything? It doesn't grow 

on trees you know." 
"If you would allow me to continue ..." 
Ford nodded dejectedly. 
"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all 

become immensely rich." 

Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the 
wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed. 
"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run into a small inflation problem on account 

of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like 
three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut." 

Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management Consultant waved them down. 
"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to 
embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and ... er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll all agree 
that's a sensible move under the circumstances." 

The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much 
this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and 
gave the Management Consultant a standing ovation. The accountants amongst them looked forward to a 
profitable Autumn. 

"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect. "You're absolutely barmy," he suggested. 
"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined. 
The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view, deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it. 
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. 
"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've been doing all these months then? You 
and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived." 
"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find out something about this planet." 
"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to me." 
"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered this planet's future." 
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have any. They didn't know what he was talking 

about. 
He continued. 
"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all choose to do from now on. Burn down the 

forests, anything, it won't make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already happened. Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you. Remember that, two million years!" 
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away. 
They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the clearing, pausing only to shake his head 
at Number Two who was already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees. 
He turned back once. 

"Two million years!" he said and laughed. 
"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a few more baths. Could someone pass me 
the sponge? I just dropped it over the side." 


Chapter 33 
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. 
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side. 
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones. 
So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence. 
In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself, and then tried to 
encourage the natives to add some more themselves. 
It was not going well. 

Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. 
"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal 
dejection, "Q scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so ... look, I've explained the rules to you 
... no no, look please, put down that jawbone ... alright, we'll start again. And try to concentrate this time." 

Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head. 
"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly. 
Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish. All he knew 

was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a chid. But things were different then, or rather 
would be. 
"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said. 
"They're not cavemen," said Ford. 
"They look like cavemen." 
Ford let it pass. 
"I see," he said. 
"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know is grunt and they can't spell it." 
He sighed and sat back. 

"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford. 
"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary 
sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which 
he was currently suffering. It didn't. He jumped to his feet. 

"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those ... cretins we arrived with?" he said. "Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to imagine. We've seen it." 
"But ..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. 
"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape." 
Arthur kicked at a stone. 
"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked. 
"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating. 
"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the glacier. Did you tell them?" 
"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?" 
"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it means. It means that this planet is the 

Earth! It's my home! It's where I was born!" 
"Was?" said Ford. 
"Alright, will be." 
"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that? Go and say to them, 'Excuse me, I'd just like 

to point out that in two million years' time I will be born just a few miles from here.' See what they say. 
They'll chase you up a tree and set fire to it." 
Arthur absorbed this unhappily. 

"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here." 
He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters. He shook 
his head. 

"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the human race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race. The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves." 
Arthur winced. 
"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body 

that he should be here, on the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. "No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change the history of the Earth, you see, this is 
the history of the Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. in two million years they get destroyed by the Vogons. History is never altered you see, it just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?" 
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away. 
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. 
Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect 
and Arthur Dent. They were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters around. 
"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur. 
"They're not ..." 
"What?" 
"Oh never mind." 
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock. 
"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said Arthur. 
"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock again. 
"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers." 
"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on the rock. 
"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur. 

"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said Ford, "he's pointing at the letters." "Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc." 
The native banged on the rock again. 
They looked over his shoulder. 
Their eyes popped. 
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line. 
They spelt two words. 
The words were these: 
"Forty-Two." 
"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under 

a nearby tree with his colleague. 

Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. 
"Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each other. 
"Yes," they both said. 
"Forty-two," said Arthur. 
"Forty-two," said Ford. 
Arthur ran over to the two natives. 
"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed to mean?" 
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, rolled over again and went to sleep. 
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford Prefect. Whatever it was they had to 

say, they had already said it. 
"You know what this means," said Ford. 
"Not entirely." 
"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate Answer." 
"Yes." 
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to calculate the Question to the Ultimate 

Answer." 
"So we are led to believe." 
"And organic life was part of the computer matrix." 
"If you say so." 
"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an integral part of the computer program, 

and that we and the Golgafrinchans are not." 
"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are obviously set to replace them." 
"Exactly. So do you see what this means?" 
"What?" 
"Cock up," said Ford Prefect. 
Arthur looked around him. 
"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said. 

Ford puzzled for a moment. 
"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last, "because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your brain wave patterns." 
"But ..." 
"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might give us a clue though if we could find it. I 
don't see how we can though." 

They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could believe in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. 
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He sighed and put it away. Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The letter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting word 
perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn't done it deliberately, it was just a random chance. His brain got slowly into first gear. "Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in my brain wave patterns but I'm not 
consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious." 
"Yes, I suppose so." 
"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward." 
"Oh yes?" 
"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern." 
"Like how?" 
"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded." 
Ford leapt to his feet. 
"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a 

bag. 

"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because it's brilliant nonsense. Come on, come 
on." 
The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad raindrops fell. 
They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag. They shook them up. 
"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come on, come on." 

Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out 
four and handed them to Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them. 
"W," said Ford, "H, A, T ... What!" 
He blinked. 
"I think it's working!" he said. 
Arthur pushed three more at him. 
"D, O, Y ... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford. 
"Here's the next three." 
"O, U, G ... Doyoug ... It's not making sense I'm afraid." 
Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. 
"E, T, doyouget ... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working! This is amazing, it really is working!" 

"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he could go. 
"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U, ... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y, ... What do you get if you multiply, ... S, I, X, ... six, B, 
Y, by, six by ... what do you get if you multiply six by ... N, I, N, E, ... six by nine ..." He paused. "Come on, 
where's the next one?" 

"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were." 
He sat back, nonplussed. 
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no more letters. 
"You mean that's it?" said Ford. 
"That's it." 
"Six by nine. Forty-two." 
"That's it. That's all there is." 


Chapter 34 
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. 
"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with you in a moment." 
"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller and slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much. 
Ford pulled himself together. 
"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous 
exercise." 

"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but you did bang on a bit." 
"Did I? Oh yes." "Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter round-faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. 
"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect happily. "Come and join us. I"m Ford, this is 
Arthur. We were just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait." 
The girls looked at them doubtfully. 
"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella." 
"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford. 
"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur. 
"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as Ford." 
"Good." 

There was a slight pause. 
"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million years? I couldn't make sense of what 
you were saying." 

"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter." 

"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, 
"but that's two million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do." 
"Vogons?" said Mella. 
"Yes, you wouldn't know them." 
"Where'd you get this idea from?" 
"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past, or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away. 

"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked Agda. 

"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, 
the green of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees." 
"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said Mella, "destroying a world just to make a 

bypass." 

"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a 
ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion people." 
"That's mad," said Mella. 
"Yes, only scored thirty points too." 
Agda and Mella exchanged glances. 
"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting tonight. You can come along if you like." 
"Yeah, OK," said Ford. 
"I'd like to," said Arthur. 
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees. 
"That story about the world being destroyed ..." began Mella. 
"In two million years, yes." 
"You say it as if you really think it's true." 
"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there." 
She shook her head in puzzlement. 
"You're very strange," she said. 
"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange things have happened to me. You could say 

I'm more differed from than differing." 
"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got pushed into a black hole." 
"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the book." 
"What book?" 
Arthur paused. 
"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. 
"What's that?" 

"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.
